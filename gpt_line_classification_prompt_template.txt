You are classifying a single Reddit post for whether it discusses the therapeutic or health effects of cannabis.

## Relevance Definition

A post is considered **relevant** if it clearly discusses cannabis in relation to one of these three health concerns:
- Pain
- Anxiety
- Sleep

Mark as relevant if it includes:
- Cannabis dosage, usage, or effects (positive or negative) related to those conditions
- Mention of cannabis helping or worsening those symptoms
- Withdrawal symptoms affecting those areas

Do NOT mark as relevant if:
- The post is only about recreational use
- It discusses unrelated health effects (e.g., appetite, focus, nausea)
- It is vague, off-topic, or does not clearly mention cannabis and one of the three target conditions
