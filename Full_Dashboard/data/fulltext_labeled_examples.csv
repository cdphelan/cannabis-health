logreg,12mq2t9,1,0.6066141685046604,1,"Tolerance build, tolerance fix, and tolerance resiliency 
TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only“awaken” after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I’m not looking to do a flush. 

I’ve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I’ve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I’ve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I’m sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends’ abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they’re smoking through a bong and I’m using a vape. 

If you all have any tips on how to strengthen your system, if it’s even possible, I’d love to hear your suggestions. Sorry for the length of the post. My hypersomnia is kicking in, so I’m kinda tryin to fill the time lol",low_confidence,1,7

Anyway, I""ll start at the beginning for a little context.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn’t handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn’t help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn’t going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn’t anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn’t taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you’re turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn’t really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I’d always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit? Do you have a similar story to mine/experience any of the same things i have and how did you get through it? and any advice or kind words in general would be appreciated too. (Also sorry if the post is a little long)

I post here on behalf of my girlfriend.

She got a prescription for cannabis since end of last year.

She has a Storz & Bickel Crafty+ vaporizer, but she has a big problem using it, because it causes stomach ache always.

She tried 4 different strains (16/1, 15/1, 8/8, 9/9) but all give the same result.

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

I’m reaching out to seek support for a cause that’s close to many of our hearts. In Santa Cruz, CA, there’s a movement to enhance access to medical cannabis for veterans, led by The Hook Outlet Dispensary in partnership with WAMM. This initiative directly supports veterans suffering from conditions like PTSD and chronic pain, providing them with much-needed relief.

Starting yesterday maybe middle of the day, under my left jaw it started to feel super sore. It feels like it’s swollen, the soreness it has makes me think it’s that but upon touching — it isn’t swollen. It does feel sore touching it, though.

Is this normal? I’m actually horrifically paranoid about everything so I’m stressed i have cancer. 

I’m a pretty heavy smoker, basically everyday. I use my vape most of the time but try to use flower at home. I have horrible anxiety and insane nausea issues so it helps a shit ton but I’m just anxious now..

I post here on behalf of my girlfriend.

She got a prescription for cannabis since end of last year.

She has a Storz & Bickel Crafty+ vaporizer, but she has a big problem using it, because it causes stomach ache always.

She tried 4 different strains (16/1, 15/1, 8/8, 9/9) but all give the same result.

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

logreg,12mq2t9,1,0.6066141685046604,1,"Tolerance build, tolerance fix, and tolerance resiliency 
TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only“awaken” after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I’m not looking to do a flush. 

I’ve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I’ve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I’ve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I’m sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends’ abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they’re smoking through a bong and I’m using a vape.

Occasionally bigger doses give me a little anxiety, dizziness, or racing heart/thoughts, so I’m considering just splitting it up in smaller doses.

Maybe smoking for so long has impeded me, or just made everything better, like I said, there's pros and cons, but I honestly don't know what I prefer.

I’m reaching out to seek support for a cause that’s close to many of our hearts. In Santa Cruz, CA, there’s a movement to enhance access to medical cannabis for veterans, led by The Hook Outlet Dispensary in partnership with WAMM. This initiative directly supports veterans suffering from conditions like PTSD and chronic pain, providing them with much-needed relief.

However, there’s a roadblock – an active petition against this effort. We’re countering with our own petition to show that there is strong community support for our veterans and their right to medicinal cannabis.

I believe this is a cause that would resonate with our community here at r/eldertrees, and I would be grateful if you would consider showing your support by signing and sharing the petition. Your signature can help ensure that veterans receive the care they need.

Anyway, I""ll start at the beginning for a little context.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn’t handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn’t help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn’t going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn’t anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn’t taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you’re turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn’t really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I’d always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit? Do you have a similar story to mine/experience any of the same things i have and how did you get through it? and any advice or kind words in general would be appreciated too. (Also sorry if the post is a little long) 

TLDR: I'm a long time heavy smoker who started having health problems and hair loss due to smoking and decided I needed to quit or take a long break to restore my health.

Consumed THC infused drink and got f**ked up some questions Last night I drank a THC infused pop called Mr.Spice, my first time consuming anything THC based since 2018. It says 10% or 10mg THC, which I feel can't be accurate based on how it got me feeling.

Ten years ago I was the typical regular smoker smoking at least a gram a day, big bong hits etc. So when I found out this drink had only 10mg of THC which is virtually nothing to a stoner, I felt it can't be right and 10% THC means something else in this drink. But either way I got super baked (felt like a Sativa to me, the drink was mixed with sugar and a bit of caffeine, but then I'm thinking if it's just THC it's infused with, is there even a Sativa or Indica? the can didn't say) and got all the typical feelings weed gives a newbie with no tolerance. Even some ""paranoia"" (that didn't concern me or cause panic ,i rode with it, it went away and it was even kind of fun"")

Are these drinks that much different from smoking regular bud, for instance is 10mg of THC in a drink the equivalent to smoking like 0.3 grams? Cause I just felt it big time, also the drink is about 7 bucks which there's no way 10mg of THC makes it that expensive.

I will follow the best I can the rules from "" **How to post as a CBD brand.** "" 

&#x200B;

So I am Lucas, co-founder of **plantandhemp**, a CBD product company (obviously)

Until now we distribute other brands that we trust ( you know how much quality is important regarding CBD) but soon we will have our own products. Only the flowers are ours ( and we are proud of them)🌱.  

We started last year and we want to grow a lot, we know the road will be long, but I know it will be worth.

We consider CBD, as a tool given by Nature. A tool that can potentially help you improve your life. Except that if you are not aware or educate, you can skip things that are important for you (and not just about CBD)

 So what we want to do, is to give you the qualities tools, with the knowledge that goes with it.    


But our mission does not stop to CBD. We want to share knowledge through the concept of the  ""**grow together**"".

We want to provide tools so everyone can move forward and progress in their lives.

 

**Let me explain!**

To put it simply, If CBD is a tool given by nature that can bring us something, our brain is also a tool, which serves us to live, to perceive the world. 

Why 2 people who live the same things don’t react the same way?  One of the answers that we wanted to bring, is: the way we use our brain, the way we see things. How life impact us and how we react to it?

We live our life, through our eyes, through our feelings, our emotions, and for each person on earth it's the same thing, there are 7 billion people, 7 billion different points of view, and it's these differences that will make us move forward and learn collectively.

Differences shouldn’t set us apart, it should gather us, to make us grow.

The more we come to perceive the world from different angles, the more we will find solutions to our problems.

We learn from others, we learn from differences. If there were only Lucas on earth, we would all have the same point of view, there would be no war, there will be good humor, confetti everywhere, but we will still live in caves...

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that we know everything, it is the opposite, I am saying that together we will give material for everyone to learn.

The idea and the ""how"" is still in process, and we will use Reddit a lot ( and of course any help, feedback is very welcome).

&#x200B;

I know I went a bit far off topic from CBD, but as CBD is a ""business"", it is where we are going to start. This plant has already helped a lot of people I know to relieve from stress and anxiety and I am sad to see that this PLANT is still banned and misunderstood.    
We want to help humanity to get back on track and reconnect with nature and with itself (just that \^\^).  


So that is who we are, if you have any question, feedback, observation ( if it is constructive ofc \^\^) please let me know

&#x200B;

Have a great day everyone, and don't forget to smile <3",false_positive,1,10

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

For the past 8 months, I've been dealing with stomach/gi tract issues. They think it's IBS because my blood work indicates im the peak of health. I've been having IBS symptoms: stabbing left abdominal pain, alternating bowel habits(const/dirr), gas, bloating, and more. Two months ago I started getting an insatiable itch all over my body. I'm talking everywhere: scalp, knees, eyes, ears, chest, face, etc. Its scabbing over like eczema now and is real deal uncomfortable. Overall, the worst symptom is easily the pain because it can be debilitating. Like I one time had to be taken to the ER and put on morphine because I legit thought I was dying from the pain. Pretty sure that was just a nasty ""flare-up"" but it was the worst single thing I've experienced in my 18 years of life. If my disease had continued at this rate for the rest of my life, I wouldn't be able to work :// Have any daily smokers had these symptoms?

svm,12mq2t9,1,0.8993728939644475,1,"Tolerance build, tolerance fix, and tolerance resiliency 
TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only“awaken” after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I’m not looking to do a flush. 

I’ve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I’ve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I’ve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I’m sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends’ abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they’re smoking through a bong and I’m using a vape. 

If you all have any tips on how to strengthen your system, if it’s even possible, I’d love to hear your suggestions. Sorry for the length of the post. My hypersomnia is kicking in, so I’m kinda tryin to fill the time lol",true_positive,0,4

Relaxes me while I’m in bed watching tv and then I sleep like a baby. 😴 I usually take one bigger dose, like 60-100mg and I’m done for the night.

8pm 30mg

This should give somewhat of a smoother high. Edibles peak in 2 hours for me, so by redosing twice I should pretty much feel the same “high” all night until I go to bed. Do you agree? Occasionally bigger doses give me a little anxiety, dizziness, or racing heart/thoughts, so I’m considering just splitting it up in smaller doses. Would this increase my tolerance since I’m taking 3 doses, or since they are smaller doses taken all within 4 hours I should be fine compared to taking the same mg just in one dose?

Can my mental illnesses have something to do with my consumption of weed? If so, how to overcome? I suffer from OCD, MDD, and GAD. I'm taking meds (high dose prozac) and speaking with a therapist. I have a goal in a couple years to join the military but before I do that, I have to take care of my mental health now. In a measure to see how well I'm progressing with my mental illnesses, I want to master weed as my first hurdle to jump. I cannot have a complete good time on it, signaling I still suffer from my mental illnesses. My first time smoking was my last time back 5yrs ago. Once I figure out how to not have a bad trip on it, or at least handle its effects, I'll know I don't suffer from my mental illnesses as much. This'll give me the confidence and bravery to endure the military journey and pass their psychiatric evaluation.

Here are some bad things I noticed when I was having a bad trip on weed for 4 hours

1. Paranoia- I was sharing a blunt with my friend at his house. I had an intrusive thought out of nowhere. I thought he wanted to rape me. This triggered a panic attack. I also thought he spiked the blunt with truth serum because I thought he wanted me to tell him I slept with his girlfriend. Which I didn't but man, I believed I did and I was biting my tongue and fighting my thoughts from saying I did.
2. Infinite regress- I couldn't stop thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking. I was able to see the mechanics of my mental illness. Seeing how my obsessions operated in my head. This shit was torture 
3. Rollercoaster of emotions- My mood or emotions were on a rollercoaster. Going high and going low. I describe this as a free-fall of my emotions. Felt my organs were sinking.
4. Punishment- I felt this bad trip was punishment for the bad things I did in my past. I felt I deserved this mental torture 
5. Spongebob [squidward falling into fly of despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UO9n_8Yoiw)\- This video is basically what it felt like inside my trip.
6. Staying quiet when I was losing my shit and not reaching for help- Its a condition I developed in fear of scaring my friends, family, authorities, or doctors. Or else I'll be put in a psychiatric hold, ruining my chances of getting in the military.
7. Trying to regain control using Naruto hand weaving techniques- I sensed I was in a genjutsu and I needed to cast a release jutsu to get out of it. I was weaving my hands for 10minutes and my friend saw I was tripping in a funny way.
8. Ankle Circles

One good thing about the trip: In the first 10minutes of smoking, my distorted reality was fun. Felt like I was on a spaceship going hyperspeed. But then the intrusive thoughts ruined it and it went downhill from there.

This initiative directly supports veterans suffering from conditions like PTSD and chronic pain, providing them with much-needed relief.

Anyway, I""ll start at the beginning for a little context.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn’t handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn’t help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn’t going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn’t anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn’t taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you’re turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn’t really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I’d always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit? Do you have a similar story to mine/experience any of the same things i have and how did you get through it? and any advice or kind words in general would be appreciated too.

it was a weird mixture of desire and fear, but not even proper desire tho bc I kept panicking thinking about how I'd start overthinking so much. Before I would usually only smoke alone bc of this, so I was stressing about being able to actually talk let alone converse normally. I also kept thinking how disappointed and demotivated I'd be if i reset all my progress back to zero. anyways luckily they didn't offer to me, I was smoking a cigarette to alleviate cravings and I think they just assumed I was good which was a MASSIVE fucking relief. I explained to my friend after who totally understood and we laughed about it briefly.

the main takeaway I wanted to write was waking up the next day and remembering i'd averted all that guilt was a high in of itself. even though it was kind of accidental luck that saved me from myself lol, I'm grateful for the experience to have taught me what it did. that I really really DONT actually want to go back to this, it's just my fucking impulsivity that was raring for a dopamine hit or something. ie the shortest relief for the longest fuckery of guilt, self-hatred, losing trust in myself and respect alongside - all that crap is NOT worth it. keep going yall, i've found every day more and more worth it",false_positive,1,5

I post here on behalf of my girlfriend.

She got a prescription for cannabis since end of last year.

She has a Storz & Bickel Crafty+ vaporizer, but she has a big problem using it, because it causes stomach ache always.

She tried 4 different strains (16/1, 15/1, 8/8, 9/9) but all give the same result.

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only“awaken” after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I’m not looking to do a flush. 

I’ve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I’ve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I’ve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I’m sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends’ abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they’re smoking through a bong and I’m using a vape.

8pm 30mg

This should give somewhat of a smoother high. Edibles peak in 2 hours for me, so by redosing twice I should pretty much feel the same “high” all night until I go to bed. Do you agree? Occasionally bigger doses give me a little anxiety, dizziness, or racing heart/thoughts, so I’m considering just splitting it up in smaller doses. Would this increase my tolerance since I’m taking 3 doses, or since they are smaller doses taken all within 4 hours I should be fine compared to taking the same mg just in one dose?

I also thought he spiked the blunt with truth serum because I thought he wanted me to tell him I slept with his girlfriend. Which I didn't but man, I believed I did and I was biting my tongue and fighting my thoughts from saying I did.
2. Infinite regress- I couldn't stop thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking. I was able to see the mechanics of my mental illness. Seeing how my obsessions operated in my head. This shit was torture 
3. Rollercoaster of emotions- My mood or emotions were on a rollercoaster. Going high and going low. I describe this as a free-fall of my emotions. Felt my organs were sinking.
4. Punishment- I felt this bad trip was punishment for the bad things I did in my past. I felt I deserved this mental torture 
5. Spongebob [squidward falling into fly of despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UO9n_8Yoiw)\- This video is basically what it felt like inside my trip.
6. Staying quiet when I was losing my shit and not reaching for help- Its a condition I developed in fear of scaring my friends, family, authorities, or doctors. Or else I'll be put in a psychiatric hold, ruining my chances of getting in the military.
7. Trying to regain control using Naruto hand weaving techniques- I sensed I was in a genjutsu and I needed to cast a release jutsu to get out of it. I was weaving my hands for 10minutes and my friend saw I was tripping in a funny way.
8. Ankle Circles

One good thing about the trip: In the first 10minutes of smoking, my distorted reality was fun. Felt like I was on a spaceship going hyperspeed. But then the intrusive thoughts ruined it and it went downhill from there.

Anyway, I""ll start at the beginning for a little context.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn’t handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn’t help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn’t going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn’t anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn’t taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you’re turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn’t really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I’d always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit?

Hi! 

I am a 32F and I’m hoping to get some advice/thoughts/opinions on using marijuana medicinally as opposed to using pharmaceuticals. 

A little backstory, I’ve been on a medication trial since July 2022 and have since been diagnosed with MDD, PMDD, ADHD, anxiety, and likely BPD. Safe to say, it’s been a really long 2+ years. 

I have been dealing with insomnia for a while now, and have recently discovered that it is likely related to anxiety. I started taking Clonazepam 0.5mg this month (that was prescribed to me last Feb for the drug withdrawal I was experiencing from Duloxetine) as I’ve been desperate for restful sleep. Turns out, it’s been giving me the easiest/best sleep I’ve had in months. After a week of them, however, I feel like garbage. 

A large part of me is wondering if marijuana may be a better alternative then doing more medication trials. I just don’t know really anything about marijuana being used medicinally to be able to decide which route I’d like to take. 

So if anybody has been using cannabis for similar reasons, has gone from a pharmaceutical to cannabis, or really has any opinions about using it for more medicinal purposes I would really love to hear your thoughts!

xgboost,1fc0etp,1,b'\xa7|\x07?',0,"*sigh* looks like I have CHS after all. A rant: Last month, I started having nausea and vomiting some days, a few moments after eating food… doctors told me it was CHS, so I stopped smoking for 2 weeks.. however, the urge to still smoke was still there… so I started smoking again I didn’t feel any negative effect on my stomach… until the last few days. Now keep in mind when I started smoking again, I only smoked half a joint then a Whole joint the next day.. it wasn’t until a few days later, when I met up with my stoner friends, that I started going overboard .. ripping the bong multiple times throughout the hours, smoking multiple joints etc. 

As for symptoms timeline: 

1. I went on a bad binge the other night when I had the munchies, definitely felt a little uneasy in the stomach the following day but no nausea/vomiting. 

2. These last few days, my boyfriend, who does not partake, has been visiting me, so I haven’t smoked.. during this time I thought I felt myself have little appetite.. not nausea but just not much desire to eat/finish meals.. And I wouldn’t say I had NO appetite.. last night I got very hungry randomly lol, nevertheless, I have eaten a lot since he was down here.. but this morning, we went out to breakfast, and moments after finishing my sandwich, I felt the urge to vomit extremely strongly.. I rushed to the bathroom, where I gagged a little bit, but wasn’t able to throw up.. haven’t had any diarrhea either besides, the day after my binge.. just this episode today.. 

After what happened last month, I’ve been so paranoid every time I smoke, analyzing every little thing my stomach feels/does that regardless of if I have CHS or not, this was probably bound to happen with that level of fear… 

Anyway, needless to say, I’m pretty upset. I kinda just feel like: man, I can never have nice things.. lol.. But this is what I get for not listening to advice the first time… not to mention how difficult these last few weeks of summer have been, with dealing with a loss, getting eczema, work trouble and being sick a lot.. I’ve been really depressed and when I smoked after my T-break, I felt so uplifted, kinda like all the depression just melted away… unlike what my anti-depressants/anxiety meds do lol. 

Anyway, I was in denial when doctors were telling me I had CHS the last time, for a few reasons, but I guess they were right. When I stopped smoking, I didn’t feel sick after about a week of not consuming. Now that I’ve started consuming again, the vomiting is back… looks like I’m gonna have to quit for good, ya’ll. 

For those of ya’ll who have quit or heavily limited consumption, any advice is appreciated..

At 7:00am, the first thing I saw was a text from one of my bffs that just said ""Oh Noooo!"" And I immediately knew what that meant.

I spent most of yesterday alone. Crying periodically. Feeling sick to my stomach with anxiety and fear. I was (and am) just so sad and so scared. No matter how much some of the men we know advocate for and support us, our rights and our bodily autonomy, we are experiencing something no man can quite understand. And they need to accept that right now and NOT tell us that it's gonna be OK, or that we shouldn't let it affect our mental health or there's nothing to worry about. 

Right now - the future feels bleak, doesn't it? I'm a 40-year-old childless white lady democrat who foolishly believed that voting for the candidate who WASN'T vowing to do active harm to our society and our way of life was a no-brainer. I was shockingly wrong. And the fact that THAT many people are totally ok with a convicted rapist in the White House is absolutely terrifying - and what a message to send to future date rapists of America. And the fact that 15+ million figured ""Eh, it's whatever"" instead of showing the fuck up is pretty devastating. 

It's ok to grieve. That's exactly what it feels like. Was texting with a friend who was trying to look on the bright side yesterday and I just wasn't having it. ""I appreciate your perspective, I'm not there yet."" I think most of us need to just be sad and scared, let all of this sink in and process it before we can even think about what to do next. But as the day wore on, I did indeed see the teeniest, tiniest pockets of hope and I'd like to share them. But if you aren't ready for that yet, that is absolutely ok, you do whatever you need to do for yourself right now. I hope you'll come back to this when you're ready.


Things I realized ... 


71 million people voted for Trump, 3 million less than last time. US Population is about 335 million, 73 million of which are under 18. Of that 260(ish) million adult population, there are just 185.6 registered voters in this country. So, only 38% of registered voters supported Trump this election.  While that's still a shockingly large number that means: WE OUTNUMBER THEM. And I'd wager that a whole lot more of that unregistered 75ish million are on our side.

Abortion was a ballot measure in 10 states. 7 of those states voted to PROTECT our right to abortion. 

Midterms historically result favorably for the opposing party. Two years feels like FOREVER away (and they're probably going to be very tough for many of us) but, we will have an opportunity to vote for change without having to wait 4 whole years. 

And for me personally - I live in a blue city in a so-red-it's-crimson Republican super-majority state. I worked the polling place in my neighborhood and saw the results when polls closed. More than 75% of the thousands of people who voted in my location voted Dem or 3rd party instead of Republican. At least I'm in a like-minded community.

And that's all I've got for pockets of positivity right now. It's not much, but it's something.

But I think the biggest thing to keep in mind - is we still have each other. I texted or talked to virtually every woman I love in my life yesterday (except the ones who I know either didn't vote or voted Republican lol - remains to be seen when I can talk to them again) and we all feel the same right now. But we all agree - it's time to lean on each other, lift each other up focus on ourselves. 

So today - be mad, outraged, furious, heart-broken, crushed. It's ok to hurt, to feel powerless and hopeless right now. This is a big fucking blow and it's gonna take a long minute to be hopeful. 

But when our grieving period comes to an end...ladies: FIGHT LIKE HELL. Because THEY WANT US to be powerless. THEY WANT to make us docile and obedient. THEY WANT us to shut the fuck up, stay home and raise babies. But WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS - and men in power should be very, very afraid of what angry women are capable of. 

And if you're anything like me and bitterly enjoy a bit of schadenfreude, definitely join the Leopards Ate My Face subreddit. There's gonna be a lot of satisfying content (albeit it enraging.)

xgboost,or7uni,1,b'\x04\xd2M?',0,"Weed and Self-Sabotage. Very interesting! Hey guys, hope you’re all well. 

Psychology student here and I recently learnt a new concept which I found super interesting. 

The concept is called “self-handicapping”, sometimes also referred to as “self-sabotaging”.

“Self-handicapping has been commonly defined as actively seeking or creating situations which will interfere with performance and therefore create an explanation for possible failure outside of individual ability attributions” 

For example, say there’s a student who has a very important test the next day and they’re afraid they won’t do well. 
They might decide to join their friends and party the night before the test instead of revising. 
Why? 
So that when they get their grade back and see that they didn’t do well, their brain instantly goes “you didn’t do well because of your friends and that party” instead of “you didn’t do well because you’re not that intelligent and you have a poor work ethic”. 

Self handicapping serves as a means of protecting the fragile human ego by shifting the blame of any prospective failure onto external factors rather than internal ones. 
It serves to preserve our self esteem. 

Does this sound familiar? 

Allow me to give you another example, this time linked to weed. 

Say there’s a person who has had social anxiety their whole life. Since discovering weed, they’ve developed a habit of smoking before social gatherings. 
Logically, this makes no sense. Why would they use a substance that impairs social skills if they already have poor social skills?
The answer is simple. 
Without weed, their poor social skills will be internalised and become damaging to their self esteem. The individual will be painfully aware of their awkwardness and will therefore be more self conscious of how others perceive them, too. 
With weed, the person’s social awkwardness will be attributed to the fact that they’re high. They will be less self conscious too, because they know that everyone else knows they’re high and will therefore link the person’s poor social skills to the weed rather than them personally. 

After some thought, I realised that I use weed to self-sabotage so many different areas of my life. 
It’s a lot easier to live with yourself as a person when you shake off personal responsibility and instead find something in the world to blame. 

Yes, it’s so comfortable keeping myself wrapped in cotton wool. I make it through the day easier, I sleep better at night. 
But my life will never change if I continue like this. 10 years from now, I’ll either be stuck in exactly the same place or I’ll be in a worse place. 

The only way out is through. I need to unwrap the cotton wool, take a long hard look in the mirror, take responsibility for my actions, and finally reclaim control over my life.

I post here on behalf of my girlfriend.

She got a prescription for cannabis since end of last year.

She has a Storz & Bickel Crafty+ vaporizer, but she has a big problem using it, because it causes stomach ache always.

She tried 4 different strains (16/1, 15/1, 8/8, 9/9) but all give the same result.

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

gpt_zero_shot,12mq2t9,1,0.9,1,"Tolerance build, tolerance fix, and tolerance resiliency 
TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only“awaken” after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I’m not looking to do a flush. 

I’ve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I’ve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I’ve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I’m sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends’ abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they’re smoking through a bong and I’m using a vape. 

If you all have any tips on how to strengthen your system, if it’s even possible, I’d love to hear your suggestions. Sorry for the length of the post. My hypersomnia is kicking in, so I’m kinda tryin to fill the time lol",true_positive,0,5
gpt_zero_shot,12vbs8f,1,0.9,1,"Do you take edibles all at once or spread it out? I’ve been taking D8 at night for almost a year. Relaxes me while I’m in bed watching tv and then I sleep like a baby. 😴 I usually take one bigger dose, like 60-100mg and I’m done for the night. Sometimes I do like 60mg and then 30mg a few hours later. I’m considering trying 30mg and redosing twice every 2 hours.

Example:  
4pm 30mg  
6pm 30mg  
8pm 30mg

This should give somewhat of a smoother high. Edibles peak in 2 hours for me, so by redosing twice I should pretty much feel the same “high” all night until I go to bed. Do you agree? Occasionally bigger doses give me a little anxiety, dizziness, or racing heart/thoughts, so I’m considering just splitting it up in smaller doses. Would this increase my tolerance since I’m taking 3 doses, or since they are smaller doses taken all within 4 hours I should be fine compared to taking the same mg just in one dose? I don’t smoke at all and I never take THC in the morning or afternoon. Just at dinner or around then.

Can my mental illnesses have something to do with my consumption of weed? If so, how to overcome? I suffer from OCD, MDD, and GAD. I'm taking meds (high dose prozac) and speaking with a therapist. I have a goal in a couple years to join the military but before I do that, I have to take care of my mental health now. In a measure to see how well I'm progressing with my mental illnesses, I want to master weed as my first hurdle to jump. I cannot have a complete good time on it, signaling I still suffer from my mental illnesses. My first time smoking was my last time back 5yrs ago. Once I figure out how to not have a bad trip on it, or at least handle its effects, I'll know I don't suffer from my mental illnesses as much. This'll give me the confidence and bravery to endure the military journey and pass their psychiatric evaluation.

Here are some bad things I noticed when I was having a bad trip on weed for 4 hours

1. Paranoia- I was sharing a blunt with my friend at his house. I had an intrusive thought out of nowhere. I thought he wanted to rape me. This triggered a panic attack. I also thought he spiked the blunt with truth serum because I thought he wanted me to tell him I slept with his girlfriend. Which I didn't but man, I believed I did and I was biting my tongue and fighting my thoughts from saying I did.
2. Infinite regress- I couldn't stop thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking. I was able to see the mechanics of my mental illness. Seeing how my obsessions operated in my head. This shit was torture 
3. Rollercoaster of emotions- My mood or emotions were on a rollercoaster. Going high and going low. I describe this as a free-fall of my emotions. Felt my organs were sinking.
4. Punishment- I felt this bad trip was punishment for the bad things I did in my past. I felt I deserved this mental torture 
5. Spongebob [squidward falling into fly of despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UO9n_8Yoiw)\- This video is basically what it felt like inside my trip.
6. Staying quiet when I was losing my shit and not reaching for help- Its a condition I developed in fear of scaring my friends, family, authorities, or doctors. Or else I'll be put in a psychiatric hold, ruining my chances of getting in the military.
7. Trying to regain control using Naruto hand weaving techniques- I sensed I was in a genjutsu and I needed to cast a release jutsu to get out of it. I was weaving my hands for 10minutes and my friend saw I was tripping in a funny way.
8. Ankle Circles

One good thing about the trip: In the first 10minutes of smoking, my distorted reality was fun. Felt like I was on a spaceship going hyperspeed. But then the intrusive thoughts ruined it and it went downhill from there.

This initiative directly supports veterans suffering from conditions like PTSD and chronic pain, providing them with much-needed relief.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn’t handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn’t help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn’t going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn’t anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn’t taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you’re turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn’t really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I’d always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit? Do you have a similar story to mine/experience any of the same things i have and how did you get through it? and any advice or kind words in general would be appreciated too. (Also sorry if the post is a little long)

I started smoking weed about ten years ago, when I was in my twenties. The effects were astonishing: I felt an amazing ability to string together such seemingly dissimilar information: high creativity. I stopped smoking it around 2019, among other things, because the effects I felt were negative: panic attacks, bloating, paranoia. Of course, these effects were due not to the marijuana itself, but to secondary factors. I went back to smoking in 2022, but the sensation did not please me because of some increased bodily ailments that led me, little by little, to tachycardia and later to paranoia. I quit again. Until this year, I gradually went back to smoking, and the effects, although not as pleasant as at the beginning, were not so unpleasant either. However, it seems to me that combustion does generate side effects on the tonsils and stomach (I am thirty years old, my health is not bad, not optimal either, but the body wears out) which makes the effect a bit unpleasant.

Three each to be exact, so we were buzzed but not anywhere close to drunk. As the night wore on, we decided to head back to my place. The plan was simple: smoke a little weed, vibe to some music, and chill. It was a routine we’d done countless times before, nothing out of the ordinary.

Once we got back to my house, I grabbed my bong, took a few rips, and passed it over to SWIM. He took a nice, deep hit, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke. We were both feeling good, lost in the tunes, just riding the wave. After a while, I thought I’d show him some of the other cannabis products I had on hand. Among them was a big baller jar containing ten grams of live batter concentrate. 

I couldn’t help but brag a little. “Check this out,” I said, twisting the jar open. The aroma immediately filled the room, pungent and sweet. I offered the jar to SWIM. “Give it a smell,” I urged, leaning over to see his reaction. 

He took a big whiff, inhaling deeply. As soon as he did, his eyes widened. “WOAH,” he exclaimed. I chuckled, nodding. “I know, right? It’s some good stuff,” I replied, expecting him to agree with a grin or maybe ask for a dab.

But his reaction wasn’t what I expected. “No, bro,” he stammered. “I’m greening out.” His face had gone pale, and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Panic surged through me as I watched his expression change. One moment he was fine, and the next, he looked like he was on the brink of passing out.

“SWIM?” I called out, concern creeping into my voice. Before I could do anything else, he slumped over and fell out of the chair, hitting the wood floor with a thud. His mouth hung open, and I watched in shock as he began to pee himself uncontrollably.

I snapped out of my daze and rushed over to him, shaking him by the shoulders. “SWIM! Wake up!” I yelled, my heart pounding in my chest. After what felt like an eternity but was probably only a few seconds, he started to come around, his eyes blinking open as he regained consciousness. 

“Jesus, man, you scared the hell out of me,” I said, helping him sit up. He looked confused and embarrassed, and I could see the shame settling in as he realized what had just happened. I handed him a towel and pointed towards the mess. “You gotta clean that up,” I said. Once he was done, I called him an Uber to get him home safely.

Now keep in mind when I started smoking again, I only smoked half a joint then a Whole joint the next day.. it wasn’t until a few days later, when I met up with my stoner friends, that I started going overboard .. ripping the bong multiple times throughout the hours, smoking multiple joints etc. 

As for symptoms timeline: 

1. I went on a bad binge the other night when I had the munchies, definitely felt a little uneasy in the stomach the following day but no nausea/vomiting. 

2. These last few days, my boyfriend, who does not partake, has been visiting me, so I haven’t smoked.. during this time I thought I felt myself have little appetite.. not nausea but just not much desire to eat/finish meals.. And I wouldn’t say I had NO appetite.. last night I got very hungry randomly lol, nevertheless, I have eaten a lot since he was down here.. but this morning, we went out to breakfast, and moments after finishing my sandwich, I felt the urge to vomit extremely strongly.. I rushed to the bathroom, where I gagged a little bit, but wasn’t able to throw up.. haven’t had any diarrhea either besides, the day after my binge.. just this episode today.. 

After what happened last month, I’ve been so paranoid every time I smoke, analyzing every little thing my stomach feels/does that regardless of if I have CHS or not, this was probably bound to happen with that level of fear… 

Anyway, needless to say, I’m pretty upset. I kinda just feel like: man, I can never have nice things.. lol.. But this is what I get for not listening to advice the first time… not to mention how difficult these last few weeks of summer have been, with dealing with a loss, getting eczema, work trouble and being sick a lot.. I’ve been really depressed and when I smoked after my T-break, I felt so uplifted, kinda like all the depression just melted away… unlike what my anti-depressants/anxiety meds do lol. 

Anyway, I was in denial when doctors were telling me I had CHS the last time, for a few reasons, but I guess they were right. When I stopped smoking, I didn’t feel sick after about a week of not consuming. Now that I’ve started consuming again, the vomiting is back… looks like I’m gonna have to quit for good, ya’ll. 

For those of ya’ll who have quit or heavily limited consumption, any advice is appreciated.. I’m disheartened 🙃😕 but I’ve heard that CHS can cause renal failure in extreme cases due to dehydration , and as someone who’s mother is suffering from that disease, I don’t want that for myself… I know what I gotta do…",false_positive,0,7

gpt_few_shot,11hg7bn,0,0.675,1,"Stomach ache after vaping Hello,

I post here on behalf of my girlfriend.

She got a prescription for cannabis since end of last year.

She has a Storz & Bickel Crafty+ vaporizer, but she has a big problem using it, because it causes stomach ache always.

She tried 4 different strains (16/1, 15/1, 8/8, 9/9) but all give the same result.

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

gpt_few_shot,12mq2t9,1,0.875,1,"Tolerance build, tolerance fix, and tolerance resiliency 
TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only“awaken” after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I’m not looking to do a flush. 

I’ve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I’ve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I’ve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I’m sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends’ abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they’re smoking through a bong and I’m using a vape. 

If you all have any tips on how to strengthen your system, if it’s even possible, I’d love to hear your suggestions. Sorry for the length of the post. My hypersomnia is kicking in, so I’m kinda tryin to fill the time lol",true_positive,0,5

8pm 30mg

This should give somewhat of a smoother high. Edibles peak in 2 hours for me, so by redosing twice I should pretty much feel the same “high” all night until I go to bed. Do you agree? Occasionally bigger doses give me a little anxiety, dizziness, or racing heart/thoughts, so I’m considering just splitting it up in smaller doses. Would this increase my tolerance since I’m taking 3 doses, or since they are smaller doses taken all within 4 hours I should be fine compared to taking the same mg just in one dose?

I have a goal in a couple years to join the military but before I do that, I have to take care of my mental health now.

Once I figure out how to not have a bad trip on it, or at least handle its effects, I'll know I don't suffer from my mental illnesses as much. This'll give me the confidence and bravery to endure the military journey and pass their psychiatric evaluation.

Here are some bad things I noticed when I was having a bad trip on weed for 4 hours

1. Paranoia- I was sharing a blunt with my friend at his house. I had an intrusive thought out of nowhere. I thought he wanted to rape me. This triggered a panic attack. I also thought he spiked the blunt with truth serum because I thought he wanted me to tell him I slept with his girlfriend. Which I didn't but man, I believed I did and I was biting my tongue and fighting my thoughts from saying I did.
2. Infinite regress- I couldn't stop thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking. I was able to see the mechanics of my mental illness. Seeing how my obsessions operated in my head. This shit was torture 
3. Rollercoaster of emotions- My mood or emotions were on a rollercoaster. Going high and going low. I describe this as a free-fall of my emotions. Felt my organs were sinking.
4. Punishment- I felt this bad trip was punishment for the bad things I did in my past. I felt I deserved this mental torture 
5. Spongebob [squidward falling into fly of despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UO9n_8Yoiw)\- This video is basically what it felt like inside my trip.
6. Staying quiet when I was losing my shit and not reaching for help- Its a condition I developed in fear of scaring my friends, family, authorities, or doctors. Or else I'll be put in a psychiatric hold, ruining my chances of getting in the military.
7. Trying to regain control using Naruto hand weaving techniques- I sensed I was in a genjutsu and I needed to cast a release jutsu to get out of it. I was weaving my hands for 10minutes and my friend saw I was tripping in a funny way.
8. Ankle Circles

One good thing about the trip: In the first 10minutes of smoking, my distorted reality was fun. Felt like I was on a spaceship going hyperspeed. But then the intrusive thoughts ruined it and it went downhill from there.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn’t handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn’t help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn’t going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn’t anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn’t taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you’re turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn’t really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I’d always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit? Do you have a similar story to mine/experience any of the same things i have and how did you get through it? and any advice or kind words in general would be appreciated too.

gpt_few_shot,1ds3ji7,0,0.675,1,Beginner questions and advice Hi all. First of all thank you in advance for any advice I can get. Gonna try to make this as short as I can. I'm looking to get into smoking. I'm looking for something that will make me relax after a stressful day. I work with special needs adults and it can be a very stressful job. I want to come home and take a hit to relax but still function. I have 2 young children so I still have alot to do when home. People have told me to just take a small hit. I have a pen and edibles but everything gets me so fucked up I end up sitting on the couch for hours and can't move. Is there a specific strain that is better for what I'm looking for? I honestly don't know anything about this stuff and don't really have any reliable source to go to. Any advice would be awesome. Have a great day!,false_negative,1,8

My first day I used it was amazing, it was my first true time trying concentrate and holy smokes it almost made me poop myself with the amount of coughing I did. But once it was as all said and done, I feel like a freshly grilled cheese on a cold winter day with a side of tomato soup. 

I felt so calm and for the first time in years it felt like I could calm down and just exist. I was so used to working and working and sleeping that I forgot to exist. In that moment I felt like both a person and not a person. And it wore off perfectly before work so I was beyond happy. Can’t wait to try it tomorrow!",true_negative,1,6

gpt_few_shot,1ez69u0,1,0.875,0,"My friend “GREENED OUT” please help… 

The night started like any other—just a casual evening at the bar with my friend, who we'll call “SWIM.” We were both in good spirits, having a few laughs and catching up over some drinks. Three each to be exact, so we were buzzed but not anywhere close to drunk. As the night wore on, we decided to head back to my place. The plan was simple: smoke a little weed, vibe to some music, and chill. It was a routine we’d done countless times before, nothing out of the ordinary.

Once we got back to my house, I grabbed my bong, took a few rips, and passed it over to SWIM. He took a nice, deep hit, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke. We were both feeling good, lost in the tunes, just riding the wave. After a while, I thought I’d show him some of the other cannabis products I had on hand. Among them was a big baller jar containing ten grams of live batter concentrate. 

I couldn’t help but brag a little. “Check this out,” I said, twisting the jar open. The aroma immediately filled the room, pungent and sweet. I offered the jar to SWIM. “Give it a smell,” I urged, leaning over to see his reaction. 

He took a big whiff, inhaling deeply. As soon as he did, his eyes widened. “WOAH,” he exclaimed. I chuckled, nodding. “I know, right? It’s some good stuff,” I replied, expecting him to agree with a grin or maybe ask for a dab.

But his reaction wasn’t what I expected. “No, bro,” he stammered. “I’m greening out.” His face had gone pale, and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Panic surged through me as I watched his expression change. One moment he was fine, and the next, he looked like he was on the brink of passing out.

“SWIM?” I called out, concern creeping into my voice. Before I could do anything else, he slumped over and fell out of the chair, hitting the wood floor with a thud. His mouth hung open, and I watched in shock as he began to pee himself uncontrollably.

I snapped out of my daze and rushed over to him, shaking him by the shoulders. “SWIM! Wake up!” I yelled, my heart pounding in my chest. After what felt like an eternity but was probably only a few seconds, he started to come around, his eyes blinking open as he regained consciousness. 

“Jesus, man, you scared the hell out of me,” I said, helping him sit up. He looked confused and embarrassed, and I could see the shame settling in as he realized what had just happened. I handed him a towel and pointed towards the mess. “You gotta clean that up,” I said. Once he was done, I called him an Uber to get him home safely.

gpt_few_shot,1fc0etp,1,0.875,0,"*sigh* looks like I have CHS after all. A rant: Last month, I started having nausea and vomiting some days, a few moments after eating food… doctors told me it was CHS, so I stopped smoking for 2 weeks.. however, the urge to still smoke was still there… so I started smoking again I didn’t feel any negative effect on my stomach… until the last few days. Now keep in mind when I started smoking again, I only smoked half a joint then a Whole joint the next day.. it wasn’t until a few days later, when I met up with my stoner friends, that I started going overboard .. ripping the bong multiple times throughout the hours, smoking multiple joints etc. 

As for symptoms timeline: 

1. I went on a bad binge the other night when I had the munchies, definitely felt a little uneasy in the stomach the following day but no nausea/vomiting. 

2. These last few days, my boyfriend, who does not partake, has been visiting me, so I haven’t smoked.. during this time I thought I felt myself have little appetite.. not nausea but just not much desire to eat/finish meals.. And I wouldn’t say I had NO appetite.. last night I got very hungry randomly lol, nevertheless, I have eaten a lot since he was down here.. but this morning, we went out to breakfast, and moments after finishing my sandwich, I felt the urge to vomit extremely strongly.. I rushed to the bathroom, where I gagged a little bit, but wasn’t able to throw up.. haven’t had any diarrhea either besides, the day after my binge.. just this episode today.. 

After what happened last month, I’ve been so paranoid every time I smoke, analyzing every little thing my stomach feels/does that regardless of if I have CHS or not, this was probably bound to happen with that level of fear… 

Anyway, needless to say, I’m pretty upset. I kinda just feel like: man, I can never have nice things.. lol.. But this is what I get for not listening to advice the first time… not to mention how difficult these last few weeks of summer have been, with dealing with a loss, getting eczema, work trouble and being sick a lot.. I’ve been really depressed and when I smoked after my T-break, I felt so uplifted, kinda like all the depression just melted away… unlike what my anti-depressants/anxiety meds do lol. 

Anyway, I was in denial when doctors were telling me I had CHS the last time, for a few reasons, but I guess they were right. When I stopped smoking, I didn’t feel sick after about a week of not consuming. Now that I’ve started consuming again, the vomiting is back… looks like I’m gonna have to quit for good, ya’ll. 

For those of ya’ll who have quit or heavily limited consumption, any advice is appreciated..
