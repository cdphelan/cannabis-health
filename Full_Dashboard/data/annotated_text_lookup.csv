12zz4d2,entwives,"afraid,stress,worry","My friend's college aged daughter has decided she no longer wants George, her 4 year old neutered cat. A cat who'd been with her since kittenhood! He's currently living at my friend's going on 2 months now, but their household already holds 3 adults, 5 children and a large, friendly and playful dog that unfortunately just doesn't get that George is *terrified* of him. So George lives a stressed and secluded life, has lost a lot of weight, and my friend has yet to find him a new home.

I myself have just moved into a small basement about a month ago, living solo for the first time since 2014 after years of room mates and relationships. I have had some mental health issues the last few years and at times struggled to do laundry or dishes etc. I've progressed but things are still bad sometimes. When I got my next cat, I already knew I wanted to get a rescue or adult cat. And here is George. But I'm afraid of the big responsibility, I haven't had my own cat since 2013. Should I adopt George? He's a gentle sweetheart but I worry I won't be a good home for him or something haha...  is it a sign? Are George and I destined to be? (Sorry if this doesn't go here, but figured this group would be honest with me in the nicest way!)"
1cdk2f9,leaves,dream,"After I turned 18, my first bf introduced me to weed. At first it was only here and there but soon it became everyday. Flash forward to when I’m 22, my dad passed unexpectedly and two months after he passed I went cold turkey. I made it almost a year and that whole time everyone was telling how proud they were of me and how happy they were for me. But I was miserable. I just dreamed of getting high everyday and it made me even madder people thought it was doing my best when I wasn’t. So I decided f it I’ll just smoke this joint tonight with my friend cause they wanna smoke with me. We’re not friends anymore, and I’ve been a mining every day multiple times a day. I want to actually quit and feel like it improved my life like a lot of people in this sub, but I’m not sure why I feel even more depressed and sad when I’m not smoking. 

Advice, thoughts? 

Thank you for answering"

1g8saso,leaves,"can't move,insomnia,sleep","I have been struggling to quit for a few years. In the last 4 1/2 years I have gotten to 9 days twice and to 1-8 days about 5 times. I am getting sooo tired of going through those first few days of awful depression and insomnia over and over. 3 days, 5 days, 6 days, 9 days etc etc just to fall back into doing it everyday for weeks or months before I manage to get one day in without it.

It took a lot of begging and pleading but I got the person to finally start keeping everything in their bedroom, not smoking outside of their bedroom, and I even got them to stop asking me to hang out and watch tv while they are stoned. But I STILL CAN'T STOP!

The reason why I can't stop is because it is just so accessible. The best advice we give eachother here on this sub is erase your dealer's number, throw away any remnants, and don't be around people who smoke. Well I can't do that because it's in my home. After going 9 days and getting so far and I should be so proud of myself, all it takes is one bad night of insomnia from meds I take for a chronic illness or one bad doctor appointment where I get bad news when I was hoping for good news, or an awful incident at work, or even just getting annoyed by the smoker who lives here because they quite literally promise they are quitting everyday for me to just give in and do it. I KNOW IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF IT WASN'T IN MY HOUSE!

I am at my wits end. Tears, depression, feeling like a failure. I don't want this crap in my house and I don't want to even be around anyone who regularly uses it! I am fed up with myself and have lost respect for myself. I can't sustain abstinence long term if it's always in my house and the person who lives with me literally makes it a part of everything. I might have to move but it's just not the best idea right now due to multiple factors. And honestly, the only way to get myself to a point where I can move, is to quit smoking completely so it is no longer negatively impacting my life.

I am so sick and tired of this. I even wish I could just go stay at a motel for a month or something to just at the very least get myself to 30 days so it is less tempting and I have a stronger foundation. But I work from home with a huge computer and a huge monitor that I can't just lug to and set up at a motel, and coming home to work from home while staying in a hotel to avoid weed makes no sense when the smoker I share an apartment with also works from home 3-4 days a week. (He doesn't smoke while working but his ritual process starts once work is over. And he smokes all weekend. And I am more than welcome to grab some, it is very very available, and if I went to a motel and came home to work, there would certainly be weed all around my apartment)

So I really can't move right now. To get myself together to a point where I can move, I need to stop smoking. But just knowing it is in my apartment and readily available, stops me from quitting. I am struggling so bad and I really really need it to not be in my house. Quitting is so difficult because it's really strong stuff and I am physically dependent on it and literally cannot sleep when I try to quit and even my therapist thinks weed withdrawals are mostly mental (Yup! I am laying in bed for 8 hours unable to sleep and it's ""mental"") 

The worst part is when we moved in together, they lied through their teeth and told me that they ""rarely smoke weed""  but they actually do it every single day and their life basically revolves around it. And they just kept promising to quit over and over. I wish they would just say ""Hey, I smoke everyday and I always will."" They still promise they are quitting and they have done it every single day for at least 6 years!!! They don't take my desires to quit seriously, and they seem more than happy to have someone else to sit around with them and do nothing except watch tv and eat junkfood.

Does anyone have any advice for how to overcome this? How to quit when it's in your house? I know the best option is to move, but I'm just not in that position right now and I need to stop smoking before I can get in that position. How can I seperate myself from it when it is in my house?"
1goa81z,vaporents,sleep,"Hello Reddit,

I switched to dry herb vaping in July with an Arizer Air Max after hearing great things. But after months of use, I’m still not impressed and wonder if I bought the wrong vaporizer or if I’m doing something wrong.

Here are my main issues:

•	⁠Flavour: Everything tastes the same—like vaping grass—even with high-quality weed (both THC and CBD). I’ve tried top-shelf and homegrown flower from my cousin, who’s a seasoned grower, and still no improvement.

•	⁠Effects: CBD makes me a bit sleepy, but nowhere near as effective as ingesting ABV. THC lacks the ‘brain disconnect’ I get from smoking.

I’ve read others had similar issues and switched to the Mighty with better results. Since most vaporizers use similar heating methods, is it really just the device?

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!"

1h59w0t,CBD,sleep,"Hello,

I've been taking a CBD tincture isolate to help me fall asleep. I started with 25mg, but that wasn't quite strong enough so I've since bumped it up to 50mg. It has drastically improved my quality of sleep.

That being said, I've started noticing that I wake up with shaky hands to the point that it's a bit difficult to write and do other things that require fine motor movements. Is this a side effect of the CBD? I've tried looking it up, but unfortunately all I can find are articles stating that it's a side effect of high doses of THC which I avoid (it unfortunately doesn't agree with me anymore.) I also don't recall this being a side effect of THC for me when I still used it, but it has been a few years so I could be wrong.

Thank you in advance for your help!"

We found out everything all the tests were fine ekg, x rays the whole 9 were looking good. I have seen other doctors and they say it is panick attacks but I feel it constantly. I tried periods of not smoking weed and i felt the symptoms still im not sure if this is something that takes time or takes a long break from weed Im willing to anything to get my head out of this funk and body feeling normal. I am also a little overweight but I dont undertand whats happening. Im generally an anxious person but this isnt normal anxiety. 

If any of you have felt this feeling and made it out ok thats what I wanna hear and what success stories you had let me know.

Update: after doing more research i found it may be linked to the doxycycline i have been taking. Currently going to get off that and see what happens if anyone has had any bad experiences with doxycycline lmk what you did to heal and feel better"

1kn4n21,Petioles,"anxiety,sleep,slept","I'm a 29 F, and I've been smoking on and off for the last 10 years. Ive taken tons of breaks, lasting anywhere from a day, and even extending past a year. 

Recently, I decided to officially quit bc I noticed it was causing me tons of issues: poor memory, truoble recalling words, terribly dry skin, raised anxiety, disturbed sleep, ect

Its been 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days, and I still don't quite feel like myself. My vocabulary has started coming back, but my personality has seemed to dull in social situations. Where I once had responses to things, my mind is terribly blank  and my responses very basic. Its extremely hard for me to connect with others 

Its a little hard for me ro fully remember myself before the weed, but I know for sure I was lighter, more positive, and extremely good at connecting with others, atleast on a 1 to 1 basis. 

I also want to add in that I havnt fully fixed my sleep cycle and have been battling to do so since I quit weed. Using it so heavily (multiple times a day) has caused me to feel extremely tired in general and I did go through a 5 year period where I slept maybe 3 hours a night, and that was if I was lucky. 

My sleep has generally improved since then, but ive had to use trazadone to help me. Even with the medication, I don't get nearly the quality I did during my childhood all the way to my mid 20s. 

I just want to hear from others to see If they've had similar experiences and If so, if there is hope that things will improve if I continue to stay sober. I no longer continue on using it and want to make it years before I even think about picking it up again. "

I stopped smoking 10 days ago. I’d been a daily smoker for 5 years, and for the last 2 years, it was 1–2 joints every night. I really want to quit, and I know I can — but at the same time, smoking gave me chills, helped with my overthinking, and calmed my anxiety.

I like watching movies and listening to music after a long day, and having a joint during those moments used to feel good. I go to the gym 3–4 times a week, I run 1–2 times too, I have a solid job contract, I read before bed… I try to stay on track.

But honestly, I don’t feel like the pressure inside is going down, even with all that. I’m bored of my routine. I have to wait until September to go on vacation, to finally get some change.

And because of that, I feel like smoking again. I don’t want to fall back, but the temptation is real. I need help to stay focused and remind myself why I stopped in the first place."

1l2by8x,entwives,sleep,"Heyo my first upload but I would have found this useful a few years ago so hopefully this helps some of you all trying to get into dry herb vaping! 

For those who want it written. 
I start my temps at 320°-330°F. Pack the bowl and light her up, wait 30s-1min once it gets up to the starting temp. Then take slow deep breaths. Long and slow are key here for pulling the Solo 2 well since it’s a ‘sipper not a ripper’. 
Every min or two I increase my temperature by 10° taking slow deep breaths for a total sesh time of 7-10mins. 
My max temp is 360°F and that stuff is cashed after, I just throw it out instead of saving it because the avb at that temp doesn’t make good edibles. I usually actually end my season on 350°F 
Remember to run a cleaning cycle and clean it out every once in a while! Q tip with rubbing alcohol to clean out the inner chamber then turn the solo up to max temp and leave it to run a full session! (10ish mins depending on ur settings)

The vapor produced will at first be lighter but just remember slow and long. Like the long part is just as important as the slow part, you have to draw it out!! At higher temps the vapor will be ‘thicker’ but eventually you will notice it tastes bad. You want at the end of the sesh for your bud to be an even brown and not burnt (there is a difference but it will take a time or two to learn) especially if you want to use this AVB to make edibles! 


I used to be a blunts only girl and it is a lot different smoking the Solo 2. I had a few months where I truly hated the Solo 2 before I worked out my personal user error and then another few months for my body to finally enjoy the high. Now I hate smoking blunts/ joints bc it just makes me feel gross (partner still loves it tho so everyone is different lol). I do recommend taking a week or so break from combustion because again, the vape is totally different. Also yall you can use other herbs like lavender which I lovvvvee using with weed to help the days I really can’t sleep. Anyways I hope everyone reading this has an amazing high! "

Have gotten a lot of good advice on this forum, but finding the right vape for myself has been quite a pain.

I bought an iolite, but it's not been great.

I have done a lot of research, and have almost 100% decided on a arizer solo or air.

Having done all this research, and seen the sheer amount of people posting about what vape they should get, I thought putting all the current knowledge into a quiz might be a worthwhile idea.

I've seen the resources on this forum which are very good, but it's all a bit technical - this quiz would just ask questions about your lifestyle, how you want to use the vape, what your experience level is etc and then give you a 3 recommendations at the end.

TL:DR: if this post gets 50 upvotes, I will put the work into making a beta version of a 'What vape is right for you' quiz/self assessment for feedback from peeps here. If not, there's no interest, and I won't bother.

8ajnd3,cbdinfo,"dream,pain,worry","As I was getting ready to cook lunch for the day a thought popped into my head that I could use some CBD Isolate from Cali Born Dreams in my dish to get a different option than just taking CBD in a tincture format.


I took a few minutes to figure out the best method because I didn’t want to use my tinctures. I couldn’t find my CBD coconut oil from raised spirits and then I remember I had some CBD Isolate from Cali Born dreams.


The CBD Isolate I added it to my mashed potatoes that I was making with steak. I bought this 5.2 L air fryer from Amazon and I have cooked chicken and fish in it this past week. The flavors are so much better than cooking on a regular stove. It is also much healthier than cooking food in a lot of oil.


I seasoned my steak strips using Oregano and thyme that are grown in the backyard along with peppercorn, Himalayan pink salt, and my favorite Caribbean complete seasoning. It takes only 20 minutes to cook.


After boiling the potatoes, mashing them up and adding seasoning I sprinkled half of the CBD powder \(500mg\) all over the potatoes. I then mixed it up really well. As I am doing this on the fly I cannot give exact amounts per serving. I estimated I was received around 40\-50 mg per serving.


The effects took a little over 2 hours and I felt the pain in my neck and shoulder slowly went away. Being able to feel relief from the pains gave me joy that the CBD Isolate was working. I was worried at first that it was not going to work. The CBD lasted in my system for more than 8 hours.


Overall I like the flexibility of using the CBD Isolate powder, however, I wish the price was cheaper. The cost of $60 per gram is much higher than others.

9vi3ax,CBD,"anxiety,nervous,overwhelmed,paranoia","I can only describe what I felt as the feeling of a hundred voices in your head (not literally) that wasnt necessarily stemmed from anxiety. It was just very easy to get distracted and I couldnt work on something for more than ten minutes. Never on time for anything, impulsive, nervous etc etc

Sounds like ADHD right? So I basically self diagnosed myself, found a psych, and went on Vyvanse. But heres the issue

The hundred voices were still there. But now I could (kinda) block em out. So all Vyvanse allowed me to do was focus on what was in front of me for a little longer than usual before being overwhelmed 

It really felt like I had no identity. Like my whole persona was just comprised of these fractal thoughts. 

I started smoking weed a few years ago. It made me think much better when I set the PAX to low temperature and took only a few hits. But it was a fine line between confidence and extra paranoia

Kratom helped. It made me confident. Good fix, but had its drawbacks of course. 

And I started vaping CBD. It actually took a few days to take effect contrary to what I read about vaping. 

But now I have one, singular, clear, and commanding, voice. Never felt this confident before. "

I've noticed that on here a lot of people feel guilty about using marijuana daily. I just want to post this to make you feel less guilty. Every teacher you ever had that you liked was probably really high, most of the time.  I am a senior in college studying education and I was scared that teachers can't smoke pot. But, from what I've learned from other teachers is that weed is the only way to deal with a shit job that no one thanks you for. And at the end of the day I am convinced that I will be a better teacher knowing that after class I can go home and smoke weed. Teachers don't get drug tested. NYC and Nevada have made it illegal to screen for marijuana for a job. We are making huge progress on marijuana reform. 

If anyone tells you that you are bad for using cannabis, they are a victim of decades of anti-marijuana propaganda that has been shoved down their throats since childhood. Reefer madness man. 

At the end of the day weed is great, if it helps you feel better about yourself than you should not feel guilty at all about your use. That's like feeling guilty when you take a Claritin or Tylenol. 

Stay medicated my friends."

The isolate oil did next to nothing for me, but the broad spectrum helped my anxiety quite a bit, which is what I use CBD for. 

I'm also open to something other than an oil/tincture, I've just heard that those are what is absorbed most quickly. I use CBD every day, and I would love something that is high concentration and comes in a bigger bottle, lol, because I've been having to order a 60ml bottle once a month. Still experimenting with dosages and different concentrations.

I suppose I'm seeking a CBD product that's as broad spectrum as possible (I seem to respond better to a combination of several cannabinoids, as I've heard most do) and has a high concentration of other cannabinoids. Lots of broad spectrum oils seem to have very little of those compared to the amount of pure CBD that they contain. However, I don't want to get high, as I use CBD during the day when I do things like driving/working. 

Bonus points if it's unflavored/plain.

But just this morning local city and county police raided each and every gas station and took all their CBD and hemp products.  To me this is a massive over reach by authorities who's narcotics team are a joke and love to make FB post every time they make a bust for a dime bag.  How do us in the community fight back against the overly heavy hand of the local sheriffs department in Madison county GA and local police like the Danielsville police department.  They gave no notice and raided all of the stores and treated business owners like criminals for selling something that is legal.  The narcotics officers have been bragging about them getting ready to make a move against business that sell CBD products.  

The majority of products sold at our stores are from well know manufactures with barcode tracking.  People my mom in particular loves using CBD gummies because they help with her arthritis pain and by taking them she can stay away from opioid medications that Drs like to push.  I guess it is ok for the pharma companies to push addictive drugs but not companies offering an all natural approach.  I know many of these business owners and they would never intestinally break the law.  I don't use CBD or THC products but many do and they are a far cry from the heavier life altering drugs out there.  Our back woods sheriffs department comprised of good ole boys and officers who like to sleep around on their wifes demonize anyone who use the products.  They put more effort into busting people for a little marijuana than they do in stopping the flow of Meth, heroin and fentanyl which has taken the lives of many in our county and first responders arriving at an overdose like to joke and treat it like ""there is one more dope head off the earth"".  This coming from first hand experience when my brother in law overdosed and despite my efforts and having Narcan on hand we were unable to save him.  Our county has it's priorities messed up when it comes to drug enforcement.  

I just want to put the Danielsville Police Department and The Madison county GA Sheriffs office on blast for what seems to be illegal search and seizures of products that are made legal through  HB. 213 the GA hemp farming act.  And any products containing less than 0.3%thc are legal for sale in GA including Delta-8 and others!  I am aware of some products testing higher and are of concern but our county is using a broad brush and from the outside looking in it looks to be illegal what they are doing.

Seeing as scientists have gone to school for several years to study the brain, I sure as HELL respect scientists. They dedicate years of their lives on research. What have you used to form your opinion? Ignorance. I'd like for you to one day meet a transsexual and see the mental pain and social scrutiny they deal with everyday. 

People that are intolerant like you truly make me sick. At this point, you just don't want to be wrong about your opinion so you will fight your ways to the death. 

Perhaps if you put down your pride and had some human empathy you could see that transsexuals are real. They suffer everyday because people like you. This is r/Trees. Everyone here is supposed to be chill as fuck. You are embarrassing to humans."

I hate to phrase this way, but being sober felt like ""being high"" almost. Being sober a day after you toked and being sober after a TB are two different animals I'd say.

Earlier in the year, I went on a 3-4 month TB for a job (which didn't even end up testing me!), but it was important for me to prove to myself that I could theoretically live without it and that I was above addiction to it, that it was my hobby but not the defining point of my lifestyle.

I think it's good for all ents to take an occasional TB, it really helps to put things in perspective and I think you end up having a better relationship with the herb in the long run too.

dk3mo53,CBD,pain,"It can kill tumor cells of SOME types of cancer in a petri dish, but so can soap.  There haven't been many scientific studies on its effects in the human body against cancer.  What there have been are a lot of wild claims and anecdotal reports of it curing ""incurable"" cancers and the like.

I see nothing wrong with using cannabis in conjunction with proven therapies to treat cancer, but I've heard of people foregoing chemo/radiation in favor of cannabis, which is a giant mistake in the majority of cases.  Cancer isn't one disease but many, with each type behaving differently.  If ""mainstream"" medicine can effectively treat your cancer and you choose against it, you've just signed your own death certificate.  (Steve Jobs, anyone?)  Bob Marley decided against surgery to remove his cancerous toe & chose to ""let Jah heal me wit' da meditations of me chalice pipe"" and we see how that turned out :(

Cannabis can help greatly with the SYMPTOMS of cancer, such as nausea, pain & appetite suppression.  But until they develop a targeted & evidence-based cancer therapy using cannabis, I wouldn't put much stock in it.  There's potential but there will be no miracle cures for the hundreds of types of cancer that exist.  (Not claiming that's what you're saying, OP.  Just speaking generally).  "

3 I bet he will be the guy to sign the law that weed is off the schedule 1 list.  I suspect it will happen next fall, weeks before the election.

f05nplm,weed,fear,"Prices are expected to rise, yes, you are correct. But as everyone is recieving the income, if you raise your prices too high you will lost A LOT of business. Because it's universal, you know everyone you see is receiving it. so if you went to a store and they were charging extortionate prices - you wouldn't buy anything from there. This applies to landlords as well, they won't increase their prices due to the fear of other people not doing it. 

And the higher minimum wage is morally really good, but once put into practice it would not be beneficial. Firstly, small business would get absolutely destroyed. Most small businesses now are running on tight margins. If these business owners had to start paying people 15 dollars an hour all of a sudden it would be a financial burden to the owner. They would cut hours, get rid of employees in order to ensure that there's enough money to put food on their table first. Also, with a higher minimum wage what would happen to those that have their jobs automated? Higher minimum wage pushes for automation to happen faster, UBI does not. Higher minimum wage doesn't help people who have had their jobs automated or the people that cannot work. Also, what about people that are recieving above 15$ an hour but are still struggling to pay bills etc. there's nothing in place for these people. Why not ease the burden on everyone with UBI because eventually it will be needed no matter what. It's better to prepare instead of react."

fibpg81,CBD,pain,My ex-wife had endometriosis was prescribed tylenol + codeine. Wasnt enough for the pain and ended up leading into hard drugs just to deal with her pain. They have methods of treating endometriosis now in the usa but I am sure they are entirely surgical. Opioid painkillers are a rabbit hole you dont want to go down especially for a pain that is going to be there at certain times whether you take them or not. Of course you could use hard drugs to bury the pain but then you will have far more problems than you are already dealing with. I found Kratom to be not very effective for serious pain. Tylenol is ok but it's like anything if you keep using it you get used to the effect. So if your doc cant refer you to a specialist to see if they have other options for you then it might be time for a new doctor.

No access to anything whatsoever and I literally haven’t slept a full night since I have been without my granddaddy purple/SFV OG Kush, oh Lord, I’m relaxing just thinking about them.

ggk6bi4,hempflowers,anxiety,"Yes there's thca, Delta 9, Delta 8, Delta 10 all are THC. Delta 8 if properly sourced is derived directly from hemp and therefore legal federally because it contains less than 0.03% Delta 9 THC. When purchasing CBD or Delta 8 you should always have access to a certificate of analysis identifying what is in the product and at what percentages. Delta 8 is more of a physical high and less of a mental high but also comes with very little to no anxiety which is often produced with Delta 9 thc. Delta aid is quickly becoming people's favorite form of THC it's a great way to get off of using so much Delta 9 or even kratom, but a head shop won't tell you that because they make so much money off of kratom. For me personally I like CBD and don't care for Delta 8. So Delta 8 THC is an isomer derived from hemp.on our packages we don't even identify it as a THC but a Delta 8 hemp derivative as suggested by an attorney."
gq3asts,trees,"afraid,anxiety,anxious,overwhelmed,panic","Tbh I can get that, it's not as ridiculous as it sounds. But I have an anxiety disorder so it's probably mostly that.

It's just that coke mainly makes you feel awake, motivated and confident and ketamine, while very intense, is an anxiolytic and sedating so usually you won't really get freaked out when it's too much for you.

Weed on the other hand is much closer to psychedelics than people imagine, it's just way easier to take too much, get anxious and overwhelmed and since it amplifies your feelings just like a psychedelic you can easily end up in a cycle where your fears get worse and worse and you're having a panic attack or getting really paranoid.     
But tbh I wouldn't say I'm ""afraid"" of it, I'm just more careful to only consume as much as I can handle now.

I may start trying a 1:1 ratio in the early evenings so I can start winding down earlier.

If you've never used any thc product before it's going to take some trial and error. I suggest some research on Leafly, then swing by a dispo that has what you're looking for and buy a few small amounts until you figure out what works for you. There will be times you smoke too much, or a strain doesn't work for you and your anxiety goes up... Just remember it's ok and make note of how much you smoked that time...

h485lu4,MMJ,"anxiety,anxious,fear","Forgive me if any of this is confusing, or abrasive, I’m terrible with words but I’ll gladly further clarify.      

Different family lines of cannabis produce entirely different compounds, and some can help while others will exacerbate your symptoms. There are over 100 different cannabinoids and dozens of chemicals produced by cannabis that affect its effect.       

If you decide to smoke long-term, it is ***inevitable*** that you’ll eventually run into cannabis that makes you more anxious, or paranoid, or what have you.       

Anxiety evolved as a way for us to recognize real world threats that we don’t believe we are capable of surpassing. Some of us just have an oversized reaction, but the basis of that fear might be more valid than we care to admit. The best way to deal with it is bettering ourselves in the things that pertain to our anxiety. If your ptsd is violence related, consider martial arts and a personal trainer."

I’d smoke two days in a row, then take two off.  Then two days became 4, then a week.  Weeks eventually turned into whole months.  There were periods where I’d quit.  Longest was from May to Nov 2022.  But I’d always start again bc I’d tell myself “Just once to mellow out”.    

But I’m done for good now.  Upon some deep self reflection, I realized that the day after smoking I was very withdrawn.  I wanted to be left alone.  I wasn’t  very fun/imaginative. Essentially I quit for my children.  I wondered how many moments I have no memory of bc I was high, or how many times they asked me to play and  said “maybe later”.  I realized there is a finite number of times they will WANT to play with me.  I don’t want to waste/take that for granted.  I want to be more emotionally available, and vibrant, and fun.

lk1v8a6,trees,"anxiety,stress","I have bouts of bad anxiety that send my mind racing for days on end. I'd get something stuck in my head, like a problem or plans for something coming up, and wouldn't be able to get my mind off of it. I'd go crazy going over things again and again and again, to the point where I'd wake up in the middle of the night with my brain screaming about it. That would up my stress levels, and keep me in a dark loop.

I tried anti-anxiety meds and they helped helped deal with the emotional end, but only helped a bit with my stress and were never able to calm my mind. I'd feel like a zombie. I tried therapy and got some coping mechanisms, and they helped for day to day anxiety, but none of them helped when I had a bad attack.

A friend of one of my brothers would stop by once and a while, and he'd usually bring a couple joints or a pen/vape, and THAT did wonders! This year was on track to be one of the worst I've had with my anxiety, and I finally got my medical card.

lok9z2q,Marijuana,afraid,">and the science backs it up.

No it does not. Much of the anti-vape science is based on assumptions from medical research done for cigarettes and vaping is simply not the same thing as smoking tobacco or marijuana. I personally think smoking out of a cart sucks but I defend the use of the technology because it's wildly successful at getting people to stop smoking tobacco. It puts me in a situation where I suggest that they not choose a vape but it is absolutely acceptable if it's that or tobacco. 

My only problem here is that science does not back up any direct correlations between vaping and long term medical issues. There are lots of things you can go get and post for me but nothing about anti-vaping medical research is anything but a supposition or partially linked in a co-morbidity so don't bring my anything that doesn't say this negative health result is the direct effect of vaping. Anything other than that is just a guess and that is causing people who would otherwise use vaping to stop smoking to be afraid that vaping is even more dangerous to you than smoking tobacco. Anti-vapers need to tone it down."

ltamacg,Petioles,sleep,"I’ll start by saying you should be commended for having the awareness and desire for self reflection at your age; I know I didn’t in my early 20s. I’m 42 now, have been smoking daily for about 25 years, and my usage ramped up significantly in 2015 after moving to a recreationally legal state. Other than that, what you’re describing regarding your conflicting feelings sounds very similar to my experience. 

I’m currently on day 23 of a tolerance break, which is my longest cessation since 2018, and that was solely the result of a 3 week trip abroad when I didn’t have access to it. My present intention is to clear my system out completely, which I expect around day 40 or so. I tested positive yesterday, so still working it out. 

I’m partially doing this as an experiment to determine if I have whatever enzyme condition that makes one immune to edibles as they’ve never worked for me, but my tolerance has been so high for years now that it’s possible I just wasn’t able to tell. E.g. I have friends who would get high from a 10g gummy, while I would take 100g of the same product and not feel it. It goes without saying that having that high of a tolerance is very, very expensive; I was spending $400-500/month at the dispensary. 

Either way, I do plan on smoking flower again as it’s an enjoyable, relaxing experience that I miss, and I’m well into a successful career so I tell myself I “deserve it”, however deluded that may sound.  

After the first week, I found that getting through the day without a bowl was easy enough, but the evenings are challenging, and on this current break I find myself having a drink or two while I typically do not drink. I’ve found it helps me sleep, but I’d rather smoke than drink for health reasons. 

Also worth noting that I have a newborn, so my typical schedule has been Interrupted, and when my wife takes her to bed a few hours before me I find myself wanting to enjoy the little sliver of “me time”. Predictably this makes me crave a bowl or two.

When I start again I plan to take a “just weekends” approach but I know from experience that this will be a challenge as I’ve tried before to smoke only in the evenings, and within a week or two have always ended up back at 2-3 times throughout the days, usually starting just after my morning coffee.

Anyway, I’d meant this to be a concise reply but I’ve clearly used it as an outlet to journal my own thoughts and struggles, so I hope it’s been insightful and/or helpful for you in some way. But truly, the fact that you’re aware of the potential issue suggests you’re on the right path. “You got this” feels a bit cliche in this sub, so I’ll just say good luck to you. 

TL;DR - You’re definitely not alone."

Taking it sublingually helped it absorb faster, and I started spreading my doses throughout the day instead of taking one big dose. This method gave me much more consistent relief for my anxiety and overall well-being. It took some trial and error, but once I found the right balance, it was a real game-changer.

Bend the plant over, tie it down or supercrop it, or just top it and cut it in half. Make the plant more squat, more bushy. Then just leave it alone, maybe put it where it can get more light, and let it flower out naturally when its bigger and summer hours start to decrease as we approach fall."

mtqhyjh,cannabis,hurt,Ya Patrick and paxton like getting behind the wheel I'm sure after most likely having a liquid lunch but drinking and driving is ok I guess I hate alcohol it changes people makes some people down right mean and to obnoxious to be around and believe me I've been around a pardon my pun but I've been around a lot of drinks in my life time including some relatives alcohol is disgusting marijuana thc-a or CBD never hurt anyone but alcohol has it kills one way or the other I can't stand Patrick as far as I'm concerned he can join Trump and musk they all three can go to Africa and live with musk and swing from the trees with the rest of the Hippocrates because that's what runs this state and this country is lying Hippocrates.
mtvyl1l,CultoftheFranklin,dream,After a second run through it's okay nothing special it's mid compared to the Georgia pie and blue dream budget. I was fresh off work but now the second run yeah I should have chose a different one lol.
mu2k3q6,leaves,anxiety,I am 1 month and a few days sober. My anxiety cleared up around the 2 week mark and by the third week I was feeling alot better than i was. I feel better than I have in years. It is worth it.
mvk9xw2,weed,anxiety,"i used smoke a lot but having some strong edibles is honestly more enjoyable because it completely alleviates my anxiety, which doesnt happen at all if i would smoke or vape while my tolerance is high."
mvrsinx,trees,"hurt,pain","I have chronic pain (mostly neck and back, knees hurt too) and I want to get some topical that actually works.  There is this brand that combines other stuff with THC and it looks all Hawaiian that's been recommended to me but now I can't remember. Anyone have any recommendations on topicals that work for pain."
