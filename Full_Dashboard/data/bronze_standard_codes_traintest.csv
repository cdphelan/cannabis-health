grz0m5h,on edge,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"My rule of thumb has always been ""give me a reason to not smoke and do nothing"". Pre-COVID, this was easy. During the summer, I was constantly out doing things and seeing friends. So, I'd only smoke during the week and occasionally on weekends when I had nothing else going on. During winter, I would find myself smoking pretty much daily, and not on days when out with friends. During COVID - smoke weed every day, except when explicitly taking a tolerance break.

That being said, I take regular tolerance breaks. I like to take a week off a few times per year and the month of November off since I ain't not shaving for a whole month. Generally I find myself being sharper and more well rested while not smoking, but always slightly on edge. I attribute that to having adult ADHD and overthinking myself into an early grave. While smoking daily or nearly daily, I find myself more relaxed and more likely to just take things as they are with no pretense. I just roll with whatever life throws at me and have a better time.",0,training_candidate,0

hlwb63d,anxious,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"I know non anxious people who enjoy that feeling of anxiety.

For you, all mental health aside, coping with all cannabis effects is 100% down to mental control. Yes, anxiety feels like shit, so fix your surroundings and mental state to reduce its intensity. It will never go away afaik, because you are messing with your brain chemistry.

I have never lived in a legal state, so idk if you can completely eliminate all sources of anxiety, obviously doing something illegal that chemically induces paranoia is going to lead to anxiety.

If you really want to keep using weed then you will teach yourself self control. Meditation, mindfulness, creation, art, music, movies, whatever you can do to enforce some kind of direction to your mental state. 

I think the best thing to do is just smoke a bit until you get paranoid and then stop tbh. I don't really think the rewards of pushing beyond paranoia are worth it. Accept it, and just find some weed that doesn't make you as paranoid.

You can push past anxiety, and the muscular spasms that cause sickness (whiteys, green ones, whatever), into somatic control, and on into pure psychedelia. Pushing into the psychedelic area through long term use is dangerous because the time to come down is in weeks, whereas when reached with single dose edibles it is in hours.

j0gmg7a,freaking out,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"Honestly, as legalization strengthens we are going to see more and more studies and probably a lot of it is going to be like this. We are going to find out there is more risk than we thought (imho).

To be honest, I worry much more about lung cancer than heart disease (my dad was a daily smoker of cigs and weed and died of various cancers). But my grandparents also had strokes, so cardiovascular health is also on my mind. A few years ago, I scheduled a hysterectomy and then read about a study that indicated higher cardiac risk after hysterectomy. And the way I chose to comfort myself was this: it is one study. Even if it's ""large"", it's only one study. Yes, I may be increasing my risk of cardiac events by having organs removed, or smoking weed, or eating refined sugar, etc. If you drive every day, you're putting yourself at much higher risk getting in the car than you are sitting down at your Volanco. 

BUT. I think it's worth listening to researchers telling us ""this is not a benign drug"". I have gone for years long stretches where I'm heavily into cannabis and then go back to being sober for a while. I'm likely about to enter another long term sober period because I've also been freaking out way too much about my health lately and being high regularly is not helping! 

I love cannabis! But I don't think it's disparaging to wonder if it's bad for us in excess, and I think it's totally fine to take some time off and get some distance from your relationship with the plant to determine whether it's worth it to you!

Cold plunges or cold showers help aswell

The truth is that you just have to feel your experience for what it is and break through the storm. Having support can be really helpful but at the end of the day you have to want it more than the comfort that you get with the weed.

It's hard and when you do it it will be rewarding, you'll know where you came from and feel proud of yourself.

My first job out of college, I worked in a tiny, near-silent room with 14 other developers. The atmosphere was crushing, the work was worse.

The last thing I remember before the crying started was looking at the tiny slot window in that Hellhole and thinking to myself ""if this is what the rest of my life is gonna be like, I quit, pass the razors"". I saw the years stretching away from me, an endless, yawning chasm of frustration and misery and loneliness.

When I think about weed, I imagine the same near-infinitely-repeating slideshow of shots from my life, and they're all of me, half unconscious on my sofa.

I don't want that. You shouldn't either. Thinking about it fills me with existential dread in the same way being cooped up in that box did.

We can do better.

And now, the bad news: if you quit for 3 - 4 days at a time, you just keep yourself in a perpetual state of craving and insomnia. I know, I tried it for 3 awful months before throwing in the towel.

lxausxk,sweating,comment,cannabiscultivation_raw_data,"I recommend a wood moisture meter instead of branch breaking (too many variables with bud sizes and branch thickness).  

While people can talk about length of the dry being critical (and I agree it certainly does help), the final moisture content is the most import ant part to retaining terpenes, and you need an objective process to keep that in the optimal cure zone.   In your case with the variable temperatures, I assume you can‚Äôt stretch the dry to 14 days without drying the buds to a crisp.  So, we all try to get an optimal RH and Temp but most importantly do not over-dry it.   There is no set number of days.  It takes longer in higher humidity and shorter in dryer areas.  I do recommend not trying this in an environment greater than 62% RH, or it will take forever to dry and could get moldy if not careful.

Hang whole plant to dry until buds first start to get crispy on the outside.  Once they first start to feel pretty crispy, start measuring internal mostiure content of the huds using a wood moisture meter.  When it gets down to mostly 12/13% in some of the larger buds on each plant, transfer to a brown paper bag (packed kind of loosely so it can breathe and be  moved around if needed‚Äîfold over the top a couple times and clip closed with binder clips)‚Äîthis is called sweating cannabis, if you want to look it up.  If drying took less than a week, make sure to test multiple spots to assure the measure is accurate.

Sweat in the paper bags for a day or two (no more than two unless it starts getting wet‚Äîthen you need to pull it out and redry‚Äîyou likely didn‚Äôt measure the moisture well and it was not ready) to start equalizing bud moisture and ease into the 10/11% optimal range (no need to measure anymore unless you want).  You can now trim and bag in grove bags with hygrometers or bag in grove bags with hygrometer and trim later at your leisure.

RH in the bags should be 57-63 within 48hours.  If it goes higher, burp it like a jar or pull it out and let it sit for about 40 minutes to and hour and rebag.  Repeat as needed until you ease it back into the cure zone.

Objective and produces a perfect cure, if you don‚Äôt deviate too far at any step.  I should add, the optimal cure is about two months in the grove bags, but while it can. Be smoked at two weeks, I would not smoke it under 4 weeks.

Edit: you can even skip the sweating, but you have to dry to 10% or 11% on the hanging plant (be careful to not over shoot) and then buck straight to a grove and trim later or buck, trim and bag and be done.

1ez69u0,heart pounding,post,weed_raw_data,"My friend ‚ÄúGREENED OUT‚Äù please help‚Ä¶ 

The night started like any other‚Äîjust a casual evening at the bar with my friend, who we'll call ‚ÄúSWIM.‚Äù We were both in good spirits, having a few laughs and catching up over some drinks. Three each to be exact, so we were buzzed but not anywhere close to drunk. As the night wore on, we decided to head back to my place. The plan was simple: smoke a little weed, vibe to some music, and chill. It was a routine we‚Äôd done countless times before, nothing out of the ordinary.

Once we got back to my house, I grabbed my bong, took a few rips, and passed it over to SWIM. He took a nice, deep hit, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke. We were both feeling good, lost in the tunes, just riding the wave. After a while, I thought I‚Äôd show him some of the other cannabis products I had on hand. Among them was a big baller jar containing ten grams of live batter concentrate. 

I couldn‚Äôt help but brag a little. ‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù I said, twisting the jar open. The aroma immediately filled the room, pungent and sweet. I offered the jar to SWIM. ‚ÄúGive it a smell,‚Äù I urged, leaning over to see his reaction. 

He took a big whiff, inhaling deeply. As soon as he did, his eyes widened. ‚ÄúWOAH,‚Äù he exclaimed. I chuckled, nodding. ‚ÄúI know, right? It‚Äôs some good stuff,‚Äù I replied, expecting him to agree with a grin or maybe ask for a dab.

But his reaction wasn‚Äôt what I expected. ‚ÄúNo, bro,‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm greening out.‚Äù His face had gone pale, and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Panic surged through me as I watched his expression change. One moment he was fine, and the next, he looked like he was on the brink of passing out.

‚ÄúSWIM?‚Äù I called out, concern creeping into my voice. Before I could do anything else, he slumped over and fell out of the chair, hitting the wood floor with a thud. His mouth hung open, and I watched in shock as he began to pee himself uncontrollably.

I snapped out of my daze and rushed over to him, shaking him by the shoulders. ‚ÄúSWIM! Wake up!‚Äù I yelled, my heart pounding in my chest. After what felt like an eternity but was probably only a few seconds, he started to come around, his eyes blinking open as he regained consciousness. 

‚ÄúJesus, man, you scared the hell out of me,‚Äù I said, helping him sit up. He looked confused and embarrassed, and I could see the shame settling in as he realized what had just happened. I handed him a towel and pointed towards the mess. ‚ÄúYou gotta clean that up,‚Äù I said. Once he was done, I called him an Uber to get him home safely.

Let's be blunt with Montel

Frequently has on doctors, nurses and parents witj children who have developmental issues or illnesses.

There is a LOT of great information in that podcast.  I would advise to only use it to reduce any social anxiety, but learn how to work under that stress without it.  High school is great for making friends, and it's good to be anxious, because you are realizing the importance of that.

I wish I had, but didn't use cannabis during high school, grades were great, but I'd give myself an f- in social aspects, so it's definitely a balance.

The beads hung in the air for a moment, hovering, and then flew into each witch, attaching itself to them and binding whatever powers they had.

As I was leaving, an apprentice or minion tried to stop me and I uttered a curse spell at her. She cowered, frightened. The funny thing was‚Ä¶it was a fake curse. I didn‚Äôt want or need to kill them.

lk7c84u,spiraling,comment,leaves_raw_data,"I was a regular smoker for a few years and I had a psychotic break when I smoked while tripping and have never been the same. I was 25 at the time. It only takes a hit or two to feel like I‚Äôm spiraling back down the rabbit hole, even after two years. It is terrifying and I hate the feeling of lack of autonomy and control over my own body and mind. Now I have strained relations with it and its use in an industry and area where it is both legal and common, despite objectively knowing how many benefits it can have for people. Years of therapy and time in general have helped, but I don‚Äôt think I will ever be the same or have the positive experiences with weed that I once did.

It numbs, but it eventually stopped calming me down and just made me a potato. Picking fights, reading into everything, with my husband, all too common already in this stage with kids and I was making it so much harder. I, too, have absolutely no idea what it feels like to be high anymore. It's come down to a chemical need with no benefit. My body gets antsy and needs it, but for no gain. Day 2. We got this.

lk8u2u7,bedtime,comment,leaves_raw_data,"I wouldn't worry about the health impact of poor sleep right now. I know easier said than done. It is somewhat overblown...and this also drives fear/anxious thoughts. 

I def turned bedtime into a monster before too with tons of rituals and elaborate setups for my room. This sends the message that sleep needs to be forced. Of course some simple things make sense with temps and lights.

If you can, try to reframe thoughts that you will be useless the next day. Even the next if you think ....I didn't sleep...I'm gonna suffer ...you prob will. Again mindset...yeah I'm gonna be tired, but I'll push thru it and it will be ok.

Try to narrow your sleeping window too. I want to sleep from 1030 to 6. I didn't even think about going to sleep until 12am the first few nights. When you start to get successful....you can slowly think about going to bed earlier. 

For acceptance...def don't lie there a anxious mess. Try to breathe and reframe whatever anxious thoughts you are having about sleep. Trying to do something like reading is great. That does help me. Most recently I watch a show on the couch and try to relax. I'll start to feel a little sleepy...I'm not trying to sleep. Then I go to my room and lay down. I think about something fun...lately pickleball and think about some shots or play some scenarios in my mind on the court. Then I'm out. I prefer to only use my bed for sleep. This isn't necessary...but does help me. If I can't sleep...I bust out a book or watch something boriing. Even if your up all night...your build a drive. Trust your body will have your back eventually. 

You need to trust your body...not try to control it. Remind yourself you will build a drive for sleep and it will come...even if it takes a few days of no sleep or very little. You will start to build upon that. It can take some time. 

Again lots of good stuff online too about ACT for insomnia. Head over to the insomnia subreddit and search ACT....lots of other great examples and stories in there. But don't research too much and def don't start obsessing about trying to perfect it. Get some concepts and try not to think too much about it.",0,training_candidate,0

So I think multi-day usage and dosage should be a larger factor. Personally, if I did it every 2 days but dosed high and/or multiple times that evening, I‚Äôd be out of responsible territory as it would severely impact my next day.

Sometimes one must just feel what one feels. I am a person with bi-polar on low end of spectrum so not terrible but I need to watch it. I totally hate feeling emotions that hurt in any way! Regardless of whether or  ot it's healthy for me, I've learned to just put all my energy into feeling what I gotta feel for no more than 90 seconds with my eyes closed and my body as still as possible while taking deep breaths. It's a trick my therapist taught me.

Almost always at the end of the 60-90 seconds the emotion intensity has eased. I also do tons of self talk, putting situations that led to emotion I don't want to feel into long term perspective. This doesn't always work but often does.

Still, sometimes I just have to announce I'm feeling bitchy so people should stay away! Only my dog should hang with me when I get like this. Bring out the Funk Mtn or Yahemi weed for me! Two lovely strains for calming the mind and helping me not give a shit about whatever may be making me bitchy.

1f09h79,can't move,post,leaves_raw_data,"Afraid that I can't quit while living with a smoking partner Hi everyone, 

It is a hard time for me right now. I am 30 yo woman and my partner is almost 40, we live together for the last 5 years. I am diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and AuDHD, and for the last few years I've been smoking weed almost daily instead of smoking that occasionally/socially. 

I know that quitting is super beneficial for me; I love myself when I'm not high more than I when I'm actually high. But I'm not sure that I can quit completely, at least at the early stage it seems unbearable. The issue is that despite the fact that I WANT to quit, I don't wan't to quit either; I admit that I enjoy it, but the tolerance level... It's something really hard to handle. And as mentioned in the title - my partner smokes A LOT. Like, on the daily basis, he says it helps him to \[...\], but I have a strong feeling that the reasoning is just an excuse. He's not taking any initiative, he seems to be lazy and having no interest to anything besides cheap dopamine resources - and forcing him to start psychotherapy is not a solution. 

But we both have jobs, I'm working on my PhD, and we also have shared business (a startup that is about to be funded soon, fingers crossed). But from here, I feel that I am the person who does 80% of everything - home routines,  negotiations, eve-ry-thing. 

The partner is a good person in general; but I see that our relationship is co-dependent, and it's about different aspects of our lives. 

I can't quit now, because of the business and other tons of issues I would need to find a way to resolve - and I'm on the edge of the burnout. I don't have any savings. And I just try to figure out how can I quit If:

1) I live with a smoker;

2) I lie to myself - saying that I won't smoke, and then I'm starting again;

3) If I can't move out now.

Even with cheeks no longer cherub chubby, she still has the most angelic face. 

I feel so alone in all of this. My heart keeps breaking and breaking and I feel so isolated in it all. I took off work when she fell ill (and am grateful I can) to give her around the clock care.

At 7:00am, the first thing I saw was a text from one of my bffs that just said ""Oh Noooo!"" And I immediately knew what that meant.

I spent most of yesterday alone. Crying periodically. Feeling sick to my stomach with anxiety and fear. I was (and am) just so sad and so scared. No matter how much some of the men we know advocate for and support us, our rights and our bodily autonomy, we are experiencing something no man can quite understand. And they need to accept that right now and NOT tell us that it's gonna be OK, or that we shouldn't let it affect our mental health or there's nothing to worry about. 

Right now - the future feels bleak, doesn't it? I'm a 40-year-old childless white lady democrat who foolishly believed that voting for the candidate who WASN'T vowing to do active harm to our society and our way of life was a no-brainer. I was shockingly wrong. And the fact that THAT many people are totally ok with a convicted rapist in the White House is absolutely terrifying - and what a message to send to future date rapists of America. And the fact that 15+ million figured ""Eh, it's whatever"" instead of showing the fuck up is pretty devastating. 

It's ok to grieve. That's exactly what it feels like. Was texting with a friend who was trying to look on the bright side yesterday and I just wasn't having it. ""I appreciate your perspective, I'm not there yet."" I think most of us need to just be sad and scared, let all of this sink in and process it before we can even think about what to do next. But as the day wore on, I did indeed see the teeniest, tiniest pockets of hope and I'd like to share them. But if you aren't ready for that yet, that is absolutely ok, you do whatever you need to do for yourself right now. I hope you'll come back to this when you're ready.


Things I realized ... 


71 million people voted for Trump, 3 million less than last time. US Population is about 335 million, 73 million of which are under 18. Of that 260(ish) million adult population, there are just 185.6 registered voters in this country. So, only 38% of registered voters supported Trump this election.  While that's still a shockingly large number that means: WE OUTNUMBER THEM. And I'd wager that a whole lot more of that unregistered 75ish million are on our side.

Abortion was a ballot measure in 10 states. 7 of those states voted to PROTECT our right to abortion. 

Midterms historically result favorably for the opposing party. Two years feels like FOREVER away (and they're probably going to be very tough for many of us) but, we will have an opportunity to vote for change without having to wait 4 whole years. 

And for me personally - I live in a blue city in a so-red-it's-crimson Republican super-majority state. I worked the polling place in my neighborhood and saw the results when polls closed. More than 75% of the thousands of people who voted in my location voted Dem or 3rd party instead of Republican. At least I'm in a like-minded community.

And that's all I've got for pockets of positivity right now. It's not much, but it's something.

But I think the biggest thing to keep in mind - is we still have each other. I texted or talked to virtually every woman I love in my life yesterday (except the ones who I know either didn't vote or voted Republican lol - remains to be seen when I can talk to them again) and we all feel the same right now. But we all agree - it's time to lean on each other, lift each other up focus on ourselves. 

So today - be mad, outraged, furious, heart-broken, crushed. It's ok to hurt, to feel powerless and hopeless right now. This is a big fucking blow and it's gonna take a long minute to be hopeful. 

But when our grieving period comes to an end...ladies: FIGHT LIKE HELL. Because THEY WANT US to be powerless. THEY WANT to make us docile and obedient. THEY WANT us to shut the fuck up, stay home and raise babies. But WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS - and men in power should be very, very afraid of what angry women are capable of. 

And if you're anything like me and bitterly enjoy a bit of schadenfreude, definitely join the Leopards Ate My Face subreddit. There's gonna be a lot of satisfying content (albeit it enraging.)

imitafl,stinging,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"I'm sorry you're struggling with this and I get hesitation to talk to docs! I tried that with about - 100% result. I got lectures about everything I already knew. I know I'm supposed to eat and what to eat but when you have a natural aversion to food or one because you had some thing in childhood (mine is you must eat all on your plate but I never got to put my own food on plate) bring told to eat is not helpful! I had opposite problem, when I started using medical cannabis my appetite, already small became non existitent. I had to learn tti eat because I had to. To maintain above 115 (I'm 5' 4"") I try to do following -
. Eat same time each day. Eat several small snacks since large meals in front on me overwhelm me and make me feel nauseous, usually 2-4 times plus small balanced dinner. Have protein or full meal shake ingredients on hand even if just almond milk and vegetable protein powder (metabolized better). Take a good vegetable based multi vitamin! Drink more fluid, plain water is best but teas are great too I love iced Chai Tea sometimes I do real and sometimes I do herbal copy cat for no caffeine. Force at least 7 bites down every 2 hours if I can't do any better. In other words, have a minimum acceptable portion or amount of calories. Follow my plan! I struggle more days than not but I haven't dropped below 115.
Still, a Doc is not a bad idea. Sometimes it's as simple as a UTI (Urinary tract infection) but even that can turn into a kidney infection that is jot fun. Yes it is possible to have a UTI without severe symptoms of burning stinging. By the time you're feeling that the infection is raging. It could also be thyroid, vitamin deficiency, or a number of other conditions which can be serious. Go to Doc with plan in place as to how you are addressing your aversion for food and much less likely to blow you off as a Psych case. Shouldn't be that way but there it is. Best of luck to you.

imt2bcc,bedtime,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"First off, take a bow for your compassion and commitment. That's god damn impressive.

Second off, you just described me, except:

* I'm a faaaaar more casual smoker -- like before bedtime, usually but not always everyday. 
* I recognized ""it"" (floating/coasting through life, no sense of joy, no motivation) and started seeing a therapist about 6 years ago, which has marginally helped.

My advice? Don't make this about smoking. Like I said, you described me (""there is no life in him at all""), except I don't smoke nearly as much or regularly as he does. Smoking is more likely to be the coping mechanism, not the cause. My coping is different but not any more health. I'm trying to find healthier ways to cope while I still work through the stuff beneath the surface. If you make it about smoking, or making it an attack on him, it could only compound whatever is inside and further push him down that path.  

For me, making it about enjoying life and striving to make every day count is what helped -- but it's also the source of my pain. I'm constantly evaluating where I am in life and anything I feel could have been better turns into the negativity. If he's going through what I am, and there's no way for either of us to know, pointing out the ""no life in him"" would likely hurt more than it would motivate.

My other advice? Reread your last sentence. You don't want to lose him. You're fighting for him. Fighters need rest, they need support and they need trainers. Consider getting yourself into therapy. A good (talk) therapist will help you in the fight to save him, but more importantly, they'll help you avoid hurting them in the process. Trying to treat something *you* can't diagnose is dangerous.  

Good luck and take care of yourself, too.",0,training_candidate,1

l5n5igb,panic,comment,cannabis_raw_data,"The DEA began with Harry Anslinger as its first administrator. Anslinger was previously head of the alcohol prohibition agency. He knew alcohol was going to be legal as prohibition was going away. Fearing for his cushy government job, he targeted cannabis. 

‚ÄúMarijuana‚Äù isn‚Äôt even the correct name. Marijuana is a name derived from a plant that grew wild in Mexico. Locals would chew on the plant and it enjoy its intoxicating effects. 

The name cannabis didn‚Äôt sound too menacing so Harry adopted the name ‚Äúmarijuana‚Äù because it sounded just ethnic enough to frighten white, suburban people. 

At the same time, William Randolph Hearst was also in panic mode because hemp was on track to replace cotton and Hearst had significant financial interests in cotton. Hemp makes a far more durable and lasting material than cotton. It‚Äôs also significantly cheaper to make things with hemp. 

Anslinger was going to lose his job and Hearst was going to lose his fortune. So they got together and launched a smear campaign against cannabis using the nonsensical ‚Äúmarijuana‚Äù name. They warned of the dangers of this terrifying plant. They insisted that the virginal white daughters would be subjected to this plant and one hit of a ‚Äúmarijuana‚Äù cigarette would find those daughters in jazz clubs cavorting  with men of color! (Pearl clutch moment.) One hit would drive a sane man to murder. Just the mere smell would surely evaporate the brain of the most brilliant man. 

As with most government lies, they pushed it until the general public demanded that it be outlawed. At the end of the day, they painted cannabis users as being black and brown people. You have to remember, the country was not too far removed from slavery at that time. So many white people were still uneasy about the existence of non-white people. So these two shitheads played on that and just like that, a harmless plant was demonized. The DEA was created and Harry Anslinger was appointed head of the agency. To this day, they still honor Harry every year on the anniversary of their founding. They will fight legalization until the bitter end because it is in their interest to do so. Same as police unions, prison guard unions, etc. 

Cannabis possession is low hanging fruit. While people in places like Colorado and California enjoy it legally, there are absolutely states where being found in possession of a bag of weed will 100% land you in a cage. As long as it‚Äôs still illegal, there will be money to made (police jobs, prison guard jobs, prison jobs in other areas that aren‚Äôt guards, etc.) If it becomes legal, there will be a noticeable drop in arrests because finding someone with a bag of weed will no longer be a crime. 

As for Biden; if you think he wants it legal, you‚Äôre woefully ignorant. Biden has been a politician for like 40 some odd years. He wrote the rave act and the 94 crime bill. He has raved and jabbered about the dangers of all manner of drugs and has stood on the senate floor and demanded that drug users go to prison. He is very much the typical politician in that he doesn‚Äôt give a damn what we the people want. The ***only*** reason he is talking about recessing now is because trump is doing better in some of the polls and the country under Biden is really struggling. Our economy is shit, we‚Äôre funding two wars that have fuck all to do with us, we‚Äôre spending more on the interest for our national debt than our entire defense budget, many think we‚Äôre potentially on the verge of either WWIII, a civil war, or both‚Ä¶.meanwhile, Biden doesn‚Äôt k ow where he is half the time. He is simply pandering for votes. And no; I‚Äôm not saying Trump is a cannabis champion. Both parties are garbage. I‚Äôm willing to bet every penny I have that Biden will talk about reclassifying weed all the way up until Election Day. Then if he gets re-elected, we will never hear another word about it. If he doesn‚Äôt get re-elected, the D party will constantly tell us all how they were ready to make a change but the people didn‚Äôt support Biden so in four more years, make sure you vote D so the will of the people can be done.

lbii6vg,dream,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"It sounds to me like you should use gummies. I get great-tasting gummies that have no unpleasant flavor to them whatsoever, and they can get me very high recreationally-speaking if I take 2-3, or I can take just 1 in the morning and one just before dinner to get a medicinal/therapeutic effect - or just 1 in the middle of the day, for the remainder of the day). Each gummy can hit pretty hard (in an oh-so-good way), so don't consider doing 2 at the same time until you know how just 1 feels.

The brand is Tillman's Tranquils. Each gummy I buy has 12 mg of Delta 9 THC, and one package of them has 15 mg of Delta 9 THC per gummy. The ones with 15 mg are called Perfect Dose. They're designed to be split in two equal halves for a 7.5 mg dose. They have a 1:1 THC:CBD 15 mg Perfect Dose gummies too, but I haven't tried them yet.

I also get a THC syrup from Tillman's as well. They have a Sativa syrup, an Indica, and a Hybrid. I started with the Sativa, re-ordered it for a while, and then I decided I should try the Hybrid and Indica syrups at some point. I started with the Hybrid and now I'm getting close to being ready to start trying the Indica.

These syrups are advertised to have 420 mg of Delta 9 THC in the bottle, but the lab report shows 412.92 mg. They say half a tablespoon contains 26.25 mg of THC, but since the bottle contains 412.92 mg in 120 mg of liquid, half a tablespoon actually contains closer to 25.80 mg. Just FYI.

Anyway, what I like about THC syrup (or really just the *idea* of THC syrup) is how easy it is to get tiny amounts of THC whenever I want (using small measuring spoons), or I can just pour it on a dinner spoon for 25 mg all at once for some fun. Or I can do just 5 mg more to make it 30. It's very luxurious to have this much control, and it's just as delicious as the gummies: there's no unpleasant flavor to it whatsoever.

I tend to use the syrup as filler between gummy doses, but I also sometimes use it as a gummy booster. I can also use the syrup more often to help me use less gummies, but I prefer the way I feel with the gummies. They have some fun names and each one is formulated to provide its own unique effect:

* Agent Orange - 12 mg
* Blue Dream - 12 mg
* Cherry Pie -12 mg
* Pineapple Express - 12 mg
* Pumpkin Spice *Perfect Dose* - 15 mg, or 7.5 if split in two
* Wedding Cake - 12 mg

So far, these gummies and the two syrups are the only products I've tried. As long as they remain available, I will keep buying them and I will try to never run out. I freakin' **love** them! üòç

My first purchase was of the Pineapple Express gummies. I loved them so much I ordered all of the above except for Pumpkin Spice. I wanted to add it to the order, but I was already over budget. So I added it to the next order and now that list of gummies is my usual order, along with a bottle of syrup.",0,training_candidate,0

lj8mpl3,discomfort,comment,leaves_raw_data,"I get hideous withdrawals. Here are some things to think about:
1. You may find it hard to fall asleep- getting up as early as you can in the morning, then getting some sun and exercise will help. Vigorous exercise is the best, but walking around slowly is also fantastic. Try to get as much sun as you can all day to support your natural circadian rhythm.
2. Your appetite may be low and you might feel nauseous - try small and often portions of salads, veggies, fruits, simple carbs, things without a lot of fat or protein (just until your stomach feels better). I used to eat raw carrot and celery sticks with hummus, maybe some toast with a tiny bit of mild cheese, couldn't stomach anything else, but this does improve and it's only frustrating for the first maybe 3-5 days.
3. You might feel a lot of emotions, cry, or get angry more than usual - getting some sun and exercise, eating well and talking to people is good.
4. You physically might feel like crap. Just try to get up and moving and socialising, warm showers seem to alleviate the discomfort a little.
5. Night sweats and shivers - the absolute worst, you'll find it hard to regulate your body temperature, especially at night. No idea what to do for this, would something like chamomile tea before bed help? You could do a little more research more on this.

ljfxu9v,discomfort,comment,petioles_raw_data,"When I go off it, I use the discomfort and suffering as an engine to engage in activities I enjoy and are healthy such as reading, going to the gym, running, going to the beach, hiking... And I just make sure my free time is jam-packed with these hobbies. Planning what I'm going to do in advance helps a great deal too. That way, I'm not suddenly confronted with idleness which can easily lead to picking up again. It might not be the healthiest existential fuel but at the end of the day I'm working towards my goals and improving which is a source of self-confidence. Plus, I'm enjoying the moment and that takes my mind off weed completely. Seeking out intense experiences that dwarf the high is key for me because they compete with the addiction and I guess the neural pathways that have been established through my cannabis consumption become weakened. I'm like I could hit the cart and that would be cool but I could also do a million other things that provide an equally or even more intense stimulus.

Besides what I've previously mentioned, avoiding self-pity, viewing the process through a relatively realistic lense and giving myself some tough love helps. The way I think of it is that I've had my fun with weed so the withdrawals are just the price I have to pay for the highs. So I grit my teeth and plough on. Obviously, practising real tender compassion toward myself is a useful tool to deploy when things get rough but it's different from self-pity. This is an essential nuance to understand imo. An example of how I practise this compassion would be: Oh Tom (that's me talking to myself) I feel like shit. (then I reply to myself ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)) Of course you feel like shit. You've been smoking for ages and now your body is learning to self-regulate without it but don't worry mate cos we' ve got this. Let's go for a run and see if you feel better. (after the run) I do feel a bit better now. Once the virtuous cycle is initiated I stack more healthy habits on top of that first one.

That was a bit long-winded, I don't even know if what I said was relevant but I hope you were able to extract some wisdom from it. Wishing you the best of luck mate. You'll be ok.

ljhy4l6,agony,comment,leaves_raw_data,"This may not be what you want to hear‚Ä¶ but I found my symptoms were equally as bad tapering off as they were with cold turkey. Not only that, but your brain receptors (that are intended for appetite, sleep, joy, sex, energy, mood regulation, etc.) get ‚Äúclogged‚Äù every time you use THC and thus are not physically capable of picking up your natural chemicals for those processes as long as you are using. When you finally drop THC altogether, that is what starts the clock to the receptors healing. Every time you give them a hit, they expect more THC is on the way and they do not engage in healing and you continue to feel really awful. The Huberman Lab podcast on weed on YouTube details the science behind this and it‚Äôs fascinating‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs one of the big reasons why tapering off doesn‚Äôt work as well as people hope. 
Appetite is involved with those receptors‚Ä¶ and the countdown for that to return will not begin until you go cold turkey :(
Again, I know this may not be what you want to hear. I too wanted to taper off when I started because going cold turkey was a huge leap‚Ä¶ but I soon found that I was prolonging the agony. I tried to taper off for two weeks and was horrifically ill daily‚Ä¶ and then when I went cold turkey I started feeling better on day three.

ljnsg00,bedtime,comment,petioles_raw_data,"First! Good for you! What a great step and if you've noticed all that negative side then it's time to recalibrate your mind and start taking back control.
 
Second! Expect to have withdrawal symptoms, maybe pretty heavy ones for the first week or few days, and it's normal, don't cave into ""I don't want to go through these so I'll just smoke"". If you have bad withdrawal symptoms it's because you saturated your body and mind with weed, and it has become your new normal. Your body has to and will surely readjust itself to natural baseline. I'm at day 2 of 90, taking a 90 days T break to really clean it all out. 

- Regular sleep schedules even if you can't sleep for a few days, wake up at the same time, and go to bed at the same time, i take supplements to help with that.

- Avoid screens at least 1-2 hours before bed

- Eat unprocessed food and avoid eating 3 hours before bedtime.

- I found that fasting helps your body get rid of THC a lot faster, you could give that a try

- Exercise, do some cardio, sweat a lot it will help for sure

- Sauna, Ice Baths, Meditation are highly recommended 

Third! Don't worry about cigarettes for now. Although it's very unhealthy, I smoke too, but you'll find yourself finding it easier to quit cigarettes when fully sober, you'll have better control over your emotions and cravings. 

Fourth! Try your very best to not replace or substitute weed for something else, you need to restore your fried dopamine receptors, so avoid social media, drinking, sugar or any quick dopamine hit, get your dopamine from stuff like exercise, a side hustle, whatever it is, reading

Best of luck to you! You're doing yourself a service and giving yourself the best gift :) It may feel hard, and negative at first, but all of this is very positive and during that time, try figuring out what type of relationship you had with weed and how you would like to redefine it... after 1 month do you feel like you want to quit forever? extend you break? Smoke once a week (which can easily spiral back into addiction) if that's the case try figuring out a plan for that.

ljy9k6x,overwhelmed,comment,leaves_raw_data,"Hey, I relate a lot to your story regarding the life changes/ADHD/anxiety etc. In fact I just relapsed around two weeks ago with weed and alcohol because I was overwhelmed, and I almost relapsed again today because I feel like I pissed people off at my job and had a meltdown at work. 

You‚Äôre not a bad person nor are you failing. Relapse is part of recovery for some of us. It‚Äôs totally understandable that you‚Äôre seeking some relief at this point in your life with everything going on. Change is hard for most people but throw anxiety and being ND in the mix and it is just a LOT!! The important thing here is that you‚Äôre taking accountability and recognizing that you‚Äôre getting back into a cycle that you don‚Äôt want to be in. 

I think the most important thing is to be gentle with yourself. Guilt or shame on top of everything will make it worse, and you really don‚Äôt have anything to be ashamed of. You‚Äôre doing your best and you can always, always quit again. 

As for some tangible things you can do now, for me I personally have had the most success with immediately physically redirecting myself. I just got back from taking a long walk and blasting music to get the energy out. Maybe try seeing a doctor (homeopathic if possible) to get some recommendations on holistic which can take the edge off as well.

Whatever you end up doing, please again be gentle with yourself. You‚Äôre not a failure. We all stumble but we can also get back up. I really hope things turn around for you soon and that you end up falling in love with your new home, wishing you all the best üíõüíõüíõüíõ",0,training_candidate,0

I think those are some great guidelines, but personally, I find it tough to stick to them. If I feel like smoking and no one‚Äôs around, I end up doing it alone. Not having a partner makes it harder to stay accountable. Fridays and Saturdays quickly turn into Sundays too.

2x a week is a good limit, but it might be too frequent too. Will you plan it in your weekly schedule, or will you let it happen spontaneously?

I agree with the idea of intentional consumption. What are some good activities for that? I think conversations, listening to music, cooking, and even walking or hiking are great. But I also feel like ne should be able to enjoy those natural highs without needing to smoke. 

That brings up the question: when is the best time to smoke? Smoking with someone else seems like the obvious answer.

ltcqdhr,melatonin,comment,petioles_raw_data,"‚ÄúA 2017 study published in the¬†Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine¬†analyzed 31 melatonin supplements and found that the amount of melatonin they contained often varied wildly from what was listed on the label. The hormone serotonin was also detected in 26% of the samples analyzed. This could be potentially harmful for some people, particularly those who are taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antidepressants that increase serotonin levels in the brain. Combining medication or supplements that jointly boost serotonin can cause it to accumulate and reach abnormally high levels in the body - a serious condition called serotonin syndrome, which can result in shivering, diarrhea, muscle rigidity, fever or seizures.‚Äù Many melatonin supplements contain additional serotonin and ingredients that should not be combined. These supplements are not regulated by the FDA at all so you have no idea what you‚Äôre getting. There is no guarantee that you‚Äôre getting ‚Äúproper‚Äù melatonin, whatever that means? Additionally melatonin is an endogenous hormone that your body makes and taking an unregulated amount for a long period of time will disrupt normal production. This supplement is only meant to be taken short term.",0,training_candidate,0

lteno0k,melatonin,comment,petioles_raw_data,"Right.  That quote lost me the second it said ""supplements""

That's over the counter shit.  Where I'm from, it's called Circadin on a pharmaceutical level.  That will not go over 2mg.

I'm familiar with Serotonin syndrome, and never in my life have I heard in any form or shape that being connected whatsoever to the pharmaceutical drug melatonin (Circadin)

These over the counter things?  Yeah.  I'd agree with all of that.   But not Circadin (Melatonin)

I agree, it is for the short term, largely, but it is indeed the SAFEST sleep aid (aside from pot) that one can take.  Generalised of course, but largely, it is safe.  I'm aware of almost no other pharmaceutical that you can take for 2 to 3 months and then just stop with absolutely zero effects.  Even antihistamines are gonna fuck you up and give you a withdrawal after that long.   That's not the case with proper melatonin.

lvskn16,discomfort,comment,vaporents_raw_data,"1) I think all that happens with a bigger bong is that it causes more cooling. This cooler vapour may allow you to take in more vapour, and that gets you higher.

2) Water is used more for moisture, I find. Once a bong is involved, it's hard to have vapour hot enough to hurt. I mean, I also have a Ruby Twist, and I sometimes use lukewarm water when doing bigger bowls. The microdose bowl doesn't really need the extra moisture, imo. But when I vape a larger volume of herb, it dries my throat out and causes me to cough a little. So a little water can condition the vapour and stop some discomfort on your throat. The only downside to water is that it diminishes the taste a little bit.

3) Some diffusion is helpful, whether it's a perc or, balls, or nipples/dimples pushed into the glass. Otherwise it means you'll have warm vapour. But a perc isn't the be all and end all imo.

I personally have 3 rigs. My main advice is to get something with a cylindrical chamber, as they are easier to clear and will be better suited to using either dry or wet. A globe is not the best for running without water, to my experience. Without the glugging action of the water, it doesn't move vapour as easily as something like a mobius sidecar. So bear in mind it takes more effort and strain.

If you decide to to ever buy a rig designed purely for being run dry - I recommend the double dragon cooling system. Great at cooling vapour and you barely have to suck in to clear it out.",0,training_candidate,0

I had to wash two plants pretty thoroughly to remove them. Noticed 10 or so during harvest, so I decided to wash those two plants. 10 turned to about 50/plant. 

First plant was kinda a learning experience. Gentle rinse in plain water and H2O2, but they were really stuck on there, so i really had to get a bit rougher than I would have liked to. Second plant was soaked in cold water and PureCrop1 for 30 mins or so, which killed/loosened them, then some gentle rinses in plain water to remove them and rinses away the purecrop. 

I have limited drying space, so was nervous that any lingering bugs would migrate over to the other plants, but I haven't noticed any bugs anywhere.

lw91hd7,overwhelmed,comment,microgrowery_raw_data,"I am not a wizard with these things, but... I have had a few plants show this sign along my time in growing. It typically points to root rot and I had lost my gals shortly thereafter.

My theory.
Shallow watering in a coco type medium makes for shallow roots for our planties, a weak system that gets overwhelmed by heavy water after a dry back. The combination of an overwater with lack of oxygen to a weak root system spells disaster. 

I now inoculate my clone starts with mycorrhizae, this can be done with seedlings too. It can even be sprinkled over the soil during a transplant. This gives fresh roots a boost to set. Do full waterings of coco mediums until you see run off, to give the root system a place to want to develop and grow. 

My suggestion is if this is a pheno you want to keep, take cuts immediately.

wghfxm,stress,post,eldertrees_raw_data,"Theory as to why weed can make some people more motivated not less There is a stereotype of the lazy stoner, however when I‚Äôve read about the lives of cannabis partakers many report having a lot of accomplishments and even that cannabis makes them more motivated not less. So I‚Äôve been thinking about this and have developed a theory:

My theory is that some people who are more ‚Äútype A‚Äù personalities actually need to relax in order to get more things done and have more even keeled and effective motivation. 

There is a big difference between stress-based doing and inspiration-based doing. Some people mostly only do the former but end up struggling with motivation and procrastination (they are also likely to have perfectionist tendencies) because they are, in effect, always pressing on the gas pedal.

So weed can actually help people like this feel more motivated rather than less because it can make their activities come from a more inspired and self-compassionate place rather than compulsion, stress, or perfectionism. It‚Äôs like being able to regulate the amount of gas being used instead of it always being pressed ‚Äúpeddle to the metal.‚Äù

Anyone else thought about this before? Agree/disagree, why/why not?

Edit: thanks everyone for all the insightful comments! Also maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äútype A‚Äù - more of what I was trying to refer to is a pattern of stress or overdrive (which any personality type might experience but some are more prone to).",0,training_candidate,0
1cx7ntt,paranoia,post,saplings_raw_data,"Ex stoner, 0 tolerance. Consumed THC infused drink and got f**ked up some questions Last night I drank a THC infused pop called Mr.Spice, my first time consuming anything THC based since 2018. It says 10% or 10mg THC, which I feel can't be accurate based on how it got me feeling.

Ten years ago I was the typical regular smoker smoking at least a gram a day, big bong hits etc. So when I found out this drink had only 10mg of THC which is virtually nothing to a stoner, I felt it can't be right and 10% THC means something else in this drink. But either way I got super baked (felt like a Sativa to me, the drink was mixed with sugar and a bit of caffeine, but then I'm thinking if it's just THC it's infused with, is there even a Sativa or Indica? the can didn't say) and got all the typical feelings weed gives a newbie with no tolerance. Even some ""paranoia"" (that didn't concern me or cause panic ,i rode with it, it went away and it was even kind of fun"")

Are these drinks that much different from smoking regular bud, for instance is 10mg of THC in a drink the equivalent to smoking like 0.3 grams? Cause I just felt it big time, also the drink is about 7 bucks which there's no way 10mg of THC makes it that expensive.

1e5mxob,spiraling,post,marijuana_raw_data,"What almost killed me ? So let me start with saying that I have a lot of experience in smoking stuff, almost 7 to 8 years. Smoking back in college,  we used to smoke 5 to 6 joints with bong hits in a day with of all kinds of stuff good, bad, laced also experience with LSD, Coke, and smack. For past two years I‚Äôm just smoking once a month , but last night, I had near death experience and it is not what I felt. It is what other people around me also told. 
So  what happened? I met few friends and they got some weed from local dealer. It was already crushed and was looking very green. They told me this is very strong stuff and one joint is good enough for four guys.
One of the guy lit it up and just took two puffs and passed it on to me. I took 2 drags and realised. I was already at my limit but everything was in control in my mind and eventually walking was pretty difficult and before I realised, these people sat me down on stairs and this happened within 15 seconds.  People who were sharing the same joint used to smoke this on daily basis, they themselves only took to 2-2 puffs each,they were high but not like me.
Next thing, I remember they were trying to explain me how to cross metal chain barrier. They were telling me to lift my left leg up in order to cross the chains, I did it and they told me to walk but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move after that I blacked out again . Next thing  I remember I was standing in front of a gate and these people were saying to enter this gate, but I blacked out again. Next thing I remember looking at some people playing pool and some offering me water. One of the guy told me to control myself because everyone was looking but unfortunately, I blacked out again and this time was the worst I remember my paranoia, kicking in, I was thinking what will happen if cops get involved and what will happen to my career? I have ruined my life back in my mind. I knew I have to listen to these people to get out of this, but I was stuck in this mental loop and this loop was getting faster and faster ( it is very hard to explain, it was not just what I was thinking. I was out of my body and I was spiraling down into this vertex, even though my mind was there and I knew what to do, I couldn‚Äôt do anything.) There was a point. I was unable to hear the instructions of the people around me . Visually I was having hallucination of a spiral and at Center of that wheel, I was there ( out of body experience). 
then I start feeling a sharp pain in my head and literally my brain, shutting down. I tried to stay awake, but finally, when I collapsed, I realised I couldn‚Äôt breathe and every muscle of my body start paining. 
(People around me, told that I was seizing, and one of the guy slapped me pretty hard to wake me up) 
After I regained consciousness I apologise to people around me and told him to take me out and get me something to drink, I couldn‚Äôt see clearly where I was. I could only see people standing in front of me like they were enlarged and really 3-D. ( like I‚Äôm wearing 3-D glasses) 
Unfortunately, my conscious phase faded away, and this time I was a beam like a beam of light that‚Äôs it. I couldn‚Äôt see or feel Anything around me not even my body d. I was just a beam of light travelling very fast at that moment, my life flashes in front of me ( not exact scenes like a movie. It was more like an experience.) 
And then I came back to my senses , I again apologise to people and told them that I am not in control right now, and if I slipped into my trip back again, please take care of me and I will come through this. Unfortunately, I slipped back in and this time. I remember I was giving a speech that I will recover from this turmoil, if I go into psychosis and become a mad person. Apparently, this time, someone splash cold water on my face and I regained consciousness. 
They drag me out of that pool table area and sat me on stairs . I did 5 to 6 vomit. There. Had some coconut drinks. Apologise to people around me I again told them that I can slip into that phase again they told me to drink some water. I open the cap of water bottle, but at that time, my body just froze. I could lift it up, but this time I was able to maintain my focus on peoples voices, and finally managed not to slip. it was already two hours in this mess.

What I know from my experience is this was something else, and I nearly escaped my death. It was not my first time with drugs or psychedelics, but this was something else you can say life changing..

On top of this, I am the recruitment chair for a fraternity (our recruitment is during September, but we work on it far before that). 

I contracted staph, I need to set up a doctor‚Äôs appointment because I urinate too frequently, I have rent payments due, student loans due, and a whole bunch of family issues that have recently come to light.

All this is to say that I feel as though I‚Äôm on the verge of tears. Im halfway through my shift at the food truck today, and all I can think about is relaxing with the dry herb vaporizer when I get home.

I have been sleeping better since I started my break, and my appetite has improved. However, I feel as though a few of my issues, such as absentmindedness, are contributed to by me constantly thinking and freaking out about one million things at once. 

I worry that I‚Äôm trying to rationalize finishing my break early, as I was hoping I could go 21 days. However, I am fairly confident that I will be able to smoke tonight and then restart another break. I am also fairly confident that if I don‚Äôt smoke weed tonight, I will drink my stress away and that seems worse to me than smoking it away.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm rambling, just a lot of thoughts in my head. Will likely add to this post as I think of things.

Addition 1: Weed never prevented me from getting done what I needed to get done. I didn‚Äôt wake and bake at all anymore, and I tried not to smoke within 3 hours of bed time. It was, however, screwing with my sleep and appetite.

TLDR: On day 9 of my first break in years. I feel as though smoking tonight would put me in a better place than not doing so. Lots of genuine responsibility that has never been sidetracked by weed. My main problem was how I felt internally.

1ez44e0,nightmares,post,leaves_raw_data,"when does the off feeling stop during sobriety i was smoking all the time for probably a year from end of sophomore yr of highschool up until summer going into senior year. so like a year and a half. i was lowk quite funny and would always crack jokes my whole life. i feel like that kinda stopped when i started smoking. 

i would literally hit the cart before i went out to do anything whether it was grocery shopping w my mom, going to work (lifeguarding), school, and anywhere else. it got to the point where being sober felt like being high. 

i stopped about a month ago and felt so happy at first. i was running everyday and lost like 17 pounds. the nightmares were horrid though, the good thing is they are starting to subside but the dreams are still pretty vivid right when i wake up. 

now the euphoric feeling of quitting is over. i just feel sad and i was way more depressed while i was smoking weed, and made way worse reckless decisions. like i would go on tinder at age 16-17 and fuck random guys at night. 

i obviously got caught eventually for basically everything since my parents rummaged thru my whole phone. basically my trust i had with them was completely shattered. 

but after i quit i got this great feeling like omg why did i smoke all the time being sober is so much better. i thought this because i never got the munchies n shi (im terrified of being fat), and because when i was high every time i spoke to someone i probably said something weird and would always have the thought like i wonder how this situation/ conversation would have went if i was sober). which is probably very differently because i act very different when im high versus im not. 

im starting to miss my personality when i was always high though. and im having bad depersonalization and derealization even though ive always had it while smoking. i thought it would go away when i was sober. it hasnt. 

like nowadays everytime i say something funny or do something good i feel like its not me. and i have so much brain fog sometimes i forget what‚Äôs happening and im just like who am i. im just confused all the time and i am wondering if its brain damage. 

i know its like brain fog but i wonder if it will go away. the thought to go back to smoking huts me everyday even though it didnt at first when i quit. 

i just feel like i was a better person when i was always high. like i just acted more chill and said what was on my mind. when im sober now it just feels weird and i feel like i overthink too much which makes me come off as cold or mean or not funny because i simply dont talk in fear of rejection. like i lowk miss being chill and goofy. and i wanna say stuff and not get the feeling like i dont feel like this is me. does this make sense

1f1ivx9,nervous,post,weed_raw_data,"i wanna take a t-break but i‚Äôm pretty nervous my dudes Since January, I‚Äôve been in intensive mental/behavioral outpatient treatment for depression as well as my substance use. I knew I had a problem and was willing to work on my use, and I did. Eventually I kinda gave up and sorta regressed. It didn‚Äôt help that there was a lot of horrible unexpected life stuff that occurred which also set my depression back a bit ‚Äî you get it.

Anyway, yeah, I knew I‚Äôd regressed in my usage, and I thought I‚Äôve just been using about as much as I did back in the spring. Helllllll nah. 36 hrs ago i bought a 0.5 gram cart from the local dispo. as of right now, all that‚Äôs left is a shallow puddle right about where the intake holes are. That freaks me the fuck out, this is the worst my use has ever been. I feel very ashamed of myself.

I know i have to put away the habit. one of my best friends, probably THE biggest stoner i know, once took a look at my carts, asked my when i‚Äôd gotten them, and when i told him his jaw dropped and he said, ‚Äúmotherfucker you EAT these!‚Äù I‚Äôve had another really close friend of mine who i met in treatment ask me ‚Äúis there anything you aren‚Äôt high for?‚Äù and when asking me how things were regarding my use and i answered honestly, he said ‚Äúand how much money has gone towards helping you out of this?‚Äù Like, it all sounds kinda mean but i definitely needed to hear it, especially from those two. It was genuinely a wake up call that only annoyed me until today when i saw the damage i‚Äôve done to this cart and that‚Äôs when it hit me.

but you guys i‚Äôm not sure how to go about this. i‚Äôm def gonna talk to my therapist about it when i see them on tuesday and try to come up with a game plan. but i don‚Äôt know if i should do a taper plan and ease into a t-break, i dont know based on my usage how long an effective t-break would be, i don‚Äôt know if i should start buying cbd or just like. herbal, non-nicotine non-thc/cbd vapes or whatever. Like, carts are my main method getting high, and its just so convenient and almost like, satisfying to inhale and pull like that. Like i feel like having something to vape might help but i dont know if like, i‚Äôll just get annoyed coz it‚Äôs not getting high? This cart won‚Äôt make it past tomorrow i fear. I‚Äôm worried i‚Äôll march right back down to the dispensary and grab another to ‚ÄúHoLd mE oVeR‚Äù until my therapist and I come up with something.

this is an incredibly daunting thing but i know it‚Äôs what i need to do to protect my physical and mental health, my wallet, and my connections with people i love. i don‚Äôt want to lose people because they think i‚Äôm giving up on getting better.

There‚Äôs so much to unpack with my therapist and im sorry for taking up so much space and unloading so much over social media, but any advice or even words of encouragement would be highly appreciated, especially if you‚Äôve ever found yourself in a similar situation to me. thank u all

also i wanna make it clear that i don‚Äôt judge other ppl‚Äôs intake or anything like that. i was using some pretty judgmental language towards myself, but that‚Äôs because I know myself and i know this is not a sustainable position for me to be in. your own usage is yours, and i don‚Äôt know you like you know you, so i‚Äôm in no way trying to say ‚Äúgoing through a 0.5g cart in less than 48 hours is Bad!‚Äù as that‚Äôs not my place. i just know me and know that that‚Äôs not great for me.

eeek ok im done yapping now thank you again

TL;DR: I go through carts Much Faster than i would like to and am heavily considering a t-break, but don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôd make it realistic and sustainable for me based on how frequently i use and how much using is built into my daily life.

1fbbw3k,tired all the time,post,petioles_raw_data,"My gentle ‚Äút break‚Äù plan: Tapering down, moderation, mindful consumption.   I discovered vape carts recently, cuz I wanted an easy portable way to smoke when I went on a lil trip.  I fell in love!  Being able to taste the terpene profile was next level.  So it became a replacement for flower, and over the course of a few months my tolerance increased and now here I am!

Noticed I was so baked it was impacting my relationship, and when I would go back to work, Monday-Tuesday there was a significantly noticeable mood dip.  I dont smoke before work, just after work and over the weekend.  And not to mention I was just so TIRED all the time, and getting such shit sleep.

So last week I was like k enough we need to feel it in.  I got a 1:1 strain cart, Maui Bubble.  And I made a flexible rule (I don‚Äôt do good with strict rules lol) that I can smoke after 8pm on weekdays.  The intention behind this is 1- not to go cold turkey and shock my poor lil brain, and 2- so that I actually have the energy to get all the things done before I smoke, and 3- I smoke less because there‚Äôs a smaller window of time to do so.

Just made it through week 1 of my new rules and my sleep drastically improved.  I felt a lot more clear headed, more energy.  

Im going to keep going with this plan, and I might make some edibles this weekend so I can use those if I want to get big high, instead of going for a high THC vape cart or whatever.  Will help to separate the instant gratification aspect, and will help me be more mindful cuz like.  You can‚Äôt just casually take an edible, you kinda gotta plan out the timing.

Weed is sooo much stronger now, and you can‚Äôt control your dosage when smoking,really. If you want to try again I suggest a low dose edible,indica, with high cbd content. Start low,like 5 mg, and work your way up. 

Look for a fast release edible if possible, and don‚Äôt take more if you think it‚Äôs not enough. 

In the situation you find yourself in now, I would abstain for at least a couple of weeks and try again as I suggested with edibles. If you feel anxious like you are now check your blood pressure.

I post here on behalf of my girlfriend.

She got a prescription for cannabis since end of last year.

She has a Storz & Bickel Crafty+ vaporizer, but she has a big problem using it, because it causes stomach ache always.

She tried 4 different strains (16/1, 15/1, 8/8, 9/9) but all give the same result.

The thing is, it happens ONLY when vaping but NOT when smoking!

Since it happens also with other herbs, like peppermint (happens when smelling peppermint tea for example), it's most likely caused by a terpene, which seems to burn when smoking, so it cannot cause aching anymore.

She has diagnosed MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) and has problems with A LOT things, and cannabis is luckily none of them, at least if not vaped :/

Oil is also no option, because it's always on MCT oil, which she can't tolerate either (already tried & failed).

Any helpful advice is very appreciated!

Best would be, which terpene might cause it, and which strains are low in that terpene?

12mq2t9,hypersomnia,post,mmj_raw_data,"Tolerance build, tolerance fix, and tolerance resiliency 
TLDR; if you take semi-regular to regular tolerance fixes, does your endocannabinoid system retain the new cb1 receptors it developed or are they killed off after a full tolerance reset? If it is the former, do they fall into your new baseline or do they only‚Äúawaken‚Äù after regular introduction of THC? Would this cause you to get higher off smaller doses for a longer period of time? If it is the latter, is there a way to strengthen your endocannabinoid system to be less susceptible to tolerance build? 

Im on day 3 of my first tolerance fix. I plan to start introducing small amounts of thc tomorrow to see how much my needed dose decreases. If I notice no significant change, I plan to take another break for longer. I know roughly 28 days is the amount of time for thc to leave your system. I‚Äôm not looking to do a flush. 

I‚Äôve got friends that have been smoking every day for years and still get wrecked. I use cannabis for pain and hypersomnia, but getting high to kick off the weekend every now and then is nice and I miss doin that. Because I use for pain and sleep, I‚Äôve had only a couple nights off in the last year since I started. 

I‚Äôve smoked only a handful of times and instead use flower with a dry herb vaporizer (mighty+ and dynavaps). I‚Äôm sure this has something to do with my increased tolerance. Still, I find the flavor and smoothness of the hits to be vastly preferred. 

I know thc binds to the cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system. I know that your body builds additional receptors as you begin introducing cannabinoids from the plant. I also know that over use can cause those new receptors to go dormant and your baseline receptors to begin losing their susceptibility to bind with thc. 

If your body is building additional cb1 receptors, would you not consistently get higher off less the more consistent you are with tolerance fixes? Would this be a cause for my friends‚Äô abilities to get stoned off smaller amounts? They are daily smokers as well. The only major difference is they‚Äôre smoking through a bong and I‚Äôm using a vape.

13rrzep,panic,post,mmj_raw_data,"I cannot handle weed but I want to be able to overcome/enjoy its effects instead of having an automatic bad trip. Can my mental illnesses have something to do with my consumption of weed? If so, how to overcome? I suffer from OCD, MDD, and GAD. I'm taking meds (high dose prozac) and speaking with a therapist. I have a goal in a couple years to join the military but before I do that, I have to take care of my mental health now. In a measure to see how well I'm progressing with my mental illnesses, I want to master weed as my first hurdle to jump. I cannot have a complete good time on it, signaling I still suffer from my mental illnesses. My first time smoking was my last time back 5yrs ago. Once I figure out how to not have a bad trip on it, or at least handle its effects, I'll know I don't suffer from my mental illnesses as much. This'll give me the confidence and bravery to endure the military journey and pass their psychiatric evaluation.

Here are some bad things I noticed when I was having a bad trip on weed for 4 hours

1. Paranoia- I was sharing a blunt with my friend at his house. I had an intrusive thought out of nowhere. I thought he wanted to rape me. This triggered a panic attack. I also thought he spiked the blunt with truth serum because I thought he wanted me to tell him I slept with his girlfriend. Which I didn't but man, I believed I did and I was biting my tongue and fighting my thoughts from saying I did.
2. Infinite regress- I couldn't stop thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking. I was able to see the mechanics of my mental illness. Seeing how my obsessions operated in my head. This shit was torture 
3. Rollercoaster of emotions- My mood or emotions were on a rollercoaster. Going high and going low. I describe this as a free-fall of my emotions. Felt my organs were sinking.
4. Punishment- I felt this bad trip was punishment for the bad things I did in my past. I felt I deserved this mental torture 
5. Spongebob [squidward falling into fly of despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UO9n_8Yoiw)\- This video is basically what it felt like inside my trip.
6. Staying quiet when I was losing my shit and not reaching for help- Its a condition I developed in fear of scaring my friends, family, authorities, or doctors. Or else I'll be put in a psychiatric hold, ruining my chances of getting in the military.
7. Trying to regain control using Naruto hand weaving techniques- I sensed I was in a genjutsu and I needed to cast a release jutsu to get out of it. I was weaving my hands for 10minutes and my friend saw I was tripping in a funny way.
8. Ankle Circles

One good thing about the trip: In the first 10minutes of smoking, my distorted reality was fun. Felt like I was on a spaceship going hyperspeed. But then the intrusive thoughts ruined it and it went downhill from there.

Day 2- Sunday morning, fought with all my might not to throw up. Shaky, nauseous, panicked. I thought i was on the edge of a panic attack for at least an hour. Ok throughout the day.

The last time i had a sinus infection it was impossible for me to get any results whatsoever - except with flower. i had tried edibles, vapes, and capsules, and none had any effect, but the heat and smoke from the flower actually helped clear my sinuses and relieve most of the pressure and pain. i now have another sinus infection, and this time around nothing i have at home is helping. vapes do nothing but burn my sinuses and send me into coughing fits, capsules make me nauseous but do nothing more, and a full tincture dropper did give me a weird head wave after 20 minutes but almost immediately wore off. edibles don't help, but anything edible generally doesn't work on me anyway, even when i'm not sick. (it usually takes anywhere from 2.5-4 hours for me to start feeling anything, if at all, and it lasts maybe 30 minutes.) i can't keep OTC meds down, so those aren't an option to relieve my symptoms, and i can't go outside to try flower, so i'm at a nearly total loss.
is this a normal correlation for people to have? i haven't found any other comments or posts so far mentioning cannabis straight up not working for people when they're sick. i typically use it medicinally for chronic illness on a daily basis and it works great across the board (minus edibles, obviously), so i'm not sure why an infection is causing the opposite to happen. do i just need to up the dosage? any insight or recommendations would be helpful.",1,training_candidate,0

The first time I assumed I took too much and was like too high or something?  But the second time I had gone back down to a lower dose and it still happened.

NOW I'm thinking that the symptoms match low blood pressure.  Of course the internet says simultaneously that delta 9 can cause high and also low blood pressure, and read some experiences where either outcome is the case, thus the internet is unhelpful.  (Saw a hilarious meme that said something like, ""Why do I have to add +reddit to all my Google searches to find what I'm looking for?"")

My question to you marijuana geniuses is, is this a likely conclusion or does it sound like something else?  And assuming this is the problem, can I counteract it or should I just stop completely and never get high again?

Side-question:  What DOES being ""too high"" on delta 9 feel like?  Do you get physically sick or anything like that, or just really whacked out mentally?

1egv0tx,discomfort,post,marijuana_raw_data,"Mari experience Hello everyone.

I started smoking weed about ten years ago, when I was in my twenties. The effects were astonishing: I felt an amazing ability to string together such seemingly dissimilar information: high creativity. I stopped smoking it around 2019, among other things, because the effects I felt were negative: panic attacks, bloating, paranoia. Of course, these effects were due not to the marijuana itself, but to secondary factors. I went back to smoking in 2022, but the sensation did not please me because of some increased bodily ailments that led me, little by little, to tachycardia and later to paranoia. I quit again. Until this year, I gradually went back to smoking, and the effects, although not as pleasant as at the beginning, were not so unpleasant either. However, it seems to me that combustion does generate side effects on the tonsils and stomach (I am thirty years old, my health is not bad, not optimal either, but the body wears out) which makes the effect a bit unpleasant. Has anyone experienced similar sensations? I have always smoked in pipes, now I am thinking of doing it with herbal vaporizer, to see if the side effect of discomfort is from the combusti√≥n.

1ev1han,spiraling,post,leaves_raw_data,"I'm just angry all the time!  I'm on day 6 today. Everything sets me off right now. My boyfriend irritates me even if he's just talking to me. If anything goes wrong in my day it just sets me into a spiraling mood of anger and irritability. I just wait for the days to be over now because it feels like I have nothing to look forward to with the major anhedonia I'm feeling. I'm literally just trying to get through the physical symptoms right now (lack of appetite, everything tasting gross and too strong, headaches, hot flashes, itchy hands and feet, nausea, anxiety, muscle cramps, insomnia) and my boyfriend wants to just spend his days off with me (we live together) but I honestly just want him to leave me alone! I think I'm starting to resent him a bit because he is still smoking and begs me to sit with him in the other room while he packs a bowl before he smokes it (I can leave the room right before he sparks it) he's also always asking for things like food, playing the Switch with me, to talk with me, and for me to cook for him (I get it, it's his days off, but holy sh*t leave me alone and take care of yourself). 

I feel like I can't handle it! I just want to scream. I hate being this angry all the time. I want to crawl under a rock and have everyone leave me alone to be miserable for a while. I've told him I just want to be alone and he seems to not get it, or he forgets after I told him (probably from smoking so much) and we just loop over and over again. This makes me feel like I'm going to relapse just so he can have an enjoyable day off or to get him off my back. He says he's supportive, but his actions (or lack of) are showing me the total opposite. 

Sorry for the rant a bit. Anyone deal with this constant anger and irritability? Tomorrow will be officially 1 week off the stuff (at midnight to be exact) and it feels like I'm just always going to be an angry person. It does run in my family, we all have short fuses and have regular outbursts of anger. It's kind of why I smoked so much to calm my anger and keep my social life and jobs. I feel like 16 year old me all over again, emotions all over the place, constantly angry at everything and the world, and wanting to just hide and completely isolate myself. Well maybe the cannabis stunted my brain development when I was a child, and maybe I'll always carry anger this way.

I know is if this keeps up, I'm not going to be able to keep a relationship or my job. I gotta figure out what to do with the anger. It's triggered mainly by my boyfriend needing things or just wanting attention. We have no friends and don't talk to either of our families, so we just have each other to rely on for social interaction really.

1ewqw68,on edge,post,leaves_raw_data,"Day 1, but I'm already in the throws (ramble and journal) First time posting, on and off lurker for a couple of years. (Actually, I forgot I was in the sub and left and joined again within a week üòû)

Context: 34. been smoking on and off from my teens. Quit in summer 22, a while after my dad passed away as the anxiety, weight loss, etc. were just too much, there was no joy. (Probably about ¬Ωoz per week)

The withdrawals were hell. I lost further weight (was underweight to start), and the anxiety completely took over (health anxiety).
I remember the sweats, the nausea, the despair, the fear. Think it was around a fortnight before I started to feel better and I swore to myself, I swore to my loved ones, that was it, I was done, it was no longer serving me. 

Fast forward to  the start of this year, and BOOM, a pack of edibles won't hurt... I'll not be smoking, I thought. I'll be OK. Ha. So, several packs of edibles later, the smoking started again. At first, I was moderating, and I would reward myself with a smoke after completing tasks. Then I done wake and bake, and the rest is history.

Weight loss started again, and I got so anxious/paranoid about the quality of my flowers and the effect on my lungs that I decided to try my own edibles. Apparently, my tolerance is the highest it's ever  been. Smoking isn't getting me there, and neither are edibles. Here's the kicker, I went into withdrawal because I cut the smoking and had the worst 2 days of my life, and didn't even realise!

 Last night, I had a small smoke to break the sweats and vicious circle of anxiety that had me convinced it was my last day on earth, and the sweating stopped for about 15 minutes!!

Cue epiphany üôÑ I lay in bed anxious and sweaty again, nauseous and empty, reading this subreddit for a few hours, eternally grateful for the others posting their experiences and advice. It's horrifying to know that so many of you are suffering, I wish it were not that way, but there is a comfort in knowing you're not alone. 

Apologies for the longwinded post, probably nonsensical in parts, but the more I write, the more accountable I can hold myself. 

So, here goes. 

Day 1- Woke up drenched after already changing through the night. Anxiety lingers.
Avoided coffee, opted for vitamin infused green tea. No appetite, so I'm slowly sipping a meal replacement drink, debating if I should avoid the scales for a while, so I'm not seeing those numbers drop üòî

Quite emotional, one minute I'm, dare I say, OK, the next I'm raging out and then I'm crying.

Not much motivation. I just want the sweating to stop. Scared to exercise, I know it will help mentally, but physically, I can't keep up with the calories or protein in the immediate days.


EDIT for day 2:
I slept about 3 hours last night, and health anxiety was rife, exhaustion eventually won. I woke feeling relatively better! Today, I have not had as much anxiety, I'm working on staying hydrated, meditating through the worst moments of the day and trying to make my food intake count for something (high nutritional content over anything), but the nausea is still preventing me from eating much. Don't know where I'd be without the amazing support of my husband. Soul searching hit hard today. A lot of self realisation, guilt, shame, and regret. BUT with those who also came quality movie time with my family, a break from all symptoms but the sweaty palms. I felt... happiness today, for the first time in longer than I care to remember, I have happy tears tonight. 

As an aside, I'll mention I have had zero cravings at any time since deciding, my weary brain knows better. 


EDIT for Day 3.

Health anxiety still there, but manageable.
Slept longer last night, but again woke up several times drenched in sweat. I think I'm having dreams again, but not quite remembering them (Probably not a bad thing!) 
I managed to eat a few light snacks today, feeling nauseous after several bites and sometimes wretching.
My legs are so achy, flu-like almost. I guess it's a culmination of lack of proper diet, exhaustion and tension. 

A positive of today and actually now just realised while typing, is also probably a contributing factor to the exhaustion is I haven't had any coffee today at all as the thought of it is turning me! So I've went from coffee with sugar probably 8-10 cups a day to nothing in a matter of 3 days... gotta take the little wins!


Edit for day 4
I'm writing this on day 5 and brain fog is at a maximum so will probably miss some, but it was a better day. I managed more sleep and less sweating, dreamed I was in a meadow (grateful it wasn't sinister) first dream of the year.
Managed ¬º of a sandwich and a toddler sized dinner before wretching both times. Cried randomly. Felt shame, guilt, remorse, embarrassment, all the things I know I need to feel and process, grateful for not being stoic. Grateful for being able to be emotionally available to my family 
Felt motivated to go to the garden and do some weeding, pulled up potatoes with my husband and daughter and had the biggest dopamine dump ‚ô•Ô∏è there's a lot to be said for getting your hands in the earth in terms of mental health.

Day 5:
Woke after an OK sleep feeling ready to take on the day and was quickly crushed by health anxiety and a return of the sweats in force. I find myself forgetting really simple things (ie well known character names) whilst remembering nightmares I had as a 5 year old. 
I practiced stretches and meditation in my garden, they help wonderfully in the moment, but it's difficult to maintain equilibrium with a busy and overstimulating household on top of all the shit in my head. Muscle fatigue is a big factor today. Zero cravings. Today has been a mix of anxiety, sadness and irritability, but there has been comfort and solace in time spent with my family, I'm so grateful for them. 
Sharing experiences with other leavers and (hopefully) helping others where I can with my own story, is really benefiting my mental health. Here's to another day sober. 


Day 6
Anxiety still lingers, but manageable with deep breathing/meditation/ reassurance from husband. What also helped is asking questions on this sub, making me feel a lot more normal and not alone. Had the motivation to exercise today, but not yet the energy, if that makes sense. Done a few sessions of tai chi instead of intensive exercise and it really helped loosen my muscles and bring anxiety levels down to bearable (one of my kids joined in half way and it was so enjoyable!). Going to bed tired tonight, fingers crossed for a better sleep. Noisy gut present, a few pains here and there but appetite is on the up, so I'm expecting there to be a little digestive upset. 

Day 7-ONE WEEK!! Feeling proud. First half of today:

Anxiety doesn't want to leave me alone so I'm just accepting things as they are for now. I'm not dead, and I didn't die the last time I quit either. I've had clear blood tests in the last month so I'm keeping that in my head too. 
Heart rate is way up today. I know it's part of it from reading here and also from past experience, trying to practice deep breathing every time I feel it's too fast. RHR has jumped about 20bpm, have noticed I'm more on edge after caffeine so have gave it up again (I was on 10+ cups coffee a day then zero on day 1 of quitting weed) it seems any more than a half cup and I'm jittery. The more days pass, the more I can recognise the symptoms that are related to withdrawal and am thankful for the advice on reddit to manage these. I went shopping today, the fresh air was nice, and I raced my daughter down the street on the way back, after advice on another post about getting that heart rate up to quell the anxiety, and it worked üí™ bonus that I had a reason for an increase in heart rate aswell. Writing this all helps to process things, another way manage and I would recommend journalling to those of you who's head seems full of fuzz. 

Day 7, PM. I had an appetite last night and thought I'd seize the opportunity for extra calories, but I ate too late, heart rate was up and I felt very aware of it. Struggled to get to sleep and woke 3 times gasping for air in a panic, 2nd half of the night was better. 

Day 8
Exhausted, groggy and anxious due to lingering effects of last night's poor sleep. Going for a walk to get the circulation going and get some fresh air. 
Heart rate still increased, hoping these symptoms relieve themselves sooner than later, it's very depressing.
PM accepted that I may have more panic attacks and after 3 minor nocturnal ones I slept well. 

Day 9 and feeling fine! Appetite is üëç heart rate is still elevated, a few palpitations here and there, manageable. Considering starting C25k again, this time last year I was running 5km a few times a week just for the craic, I'm aiming to be there again by Halloween.

I‚Äôm sitting here at one week and one day clean, and yesterday really hit me hard. I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 19, and now, at 27, I‚Äôm finally starting to see just how deep this addiction runs.

Last year, I managed to quit for about 4 months. I thought I had it under control. I told myself I could just smoke at social gatherings or concerts, no big deal, right? But before I knew it, I was back to smoking daily, with a few short-lived attempts at quitting in between.

Yesterday was a major struggle. I had no energy at all, like I was dragging myself through the day. I didn‚Äôt do anything, but somehow it felt like I‚Äôd done so much. I was sick, exhausted both mentally and physically, and really depressed. It was hard to even transition between simple tasks. Just going downstairs to eat the dinner my girlfriend made felt like a monumental effort. And then, getting up to do the dishes afterward? It was almost too much.

The first time I quit, I went through three weeks of depression and no appetite. I thought that was bad, but yesterday was different. Yesterday made me realize that this is truly an addiction. I always thought it was just a mental thing, not a physical addiction like other substances. But the way I felt yesterday showed me just how wrong I was. 

I'm sharing this because I know I‚Äôm not alone. If you‚Äôre struggling too, just know that it‚Äôs okay to have these days. It‚Äôs okay to feel like this, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre weak. It just means you‚Äôre fighting something that‚Äôs been holding you down for a long time.

1f068te,chest tightness,post,petioles_raw_data,"Anxiety suddenly worsening with weed over the last year Hello,

I'm a 20-year-old guy. The drinking age is 18 where I live and weed is illegal, so I have to buy it on the street but luckily it's good quality. I have struggled with anxiety problems since I was 15. I've been smoking weed since I was 13 but it was quite infrequent, once a month, until I was about 16 when my usage slowly increased. Since 18 I've been a regular user, a couple of times a week and periods of daily use. I understand my use at a young age was irresponsible. I can't change the past. 

At the end of last year, it was like a switch flipped and weed started making me anxious and I started having panic attacks, focused on heartbeat and chest tightness/pain. My general anxiety has increased and I've cleaned up my diet and sleeping, gone to counselling again and started using Xanax as needed. I've learned to manage this anxiety with breathing and things are better lately but I'm so frustrated I can't seem to enjoy weed like I used to. Taking a benzo while being stoned absolutely fixes my problem - but this isn't a safe long term solution and I am very cautious.

I have experimented a lot and to my surprise, weed is the one thing that consistently makes me anxious now. You'd think stimulants and psychedelics would do it, but not really. I have plenty of friends my age who've experienced the exact same thing with weed.

Mixing my weed with CBD helps a lot. I also mostly dry herb vape now. I'm at a stage now where I know I need to reduce my usage from near-daily to weekends. For now I'm planning to take a tolerance break but I really struggle with the urge to smoke in the evenings.

Has anyone here had a similar experience and figured out a solution? What did you end up doing?",1,training_candidate,0

Weed use to be so fucking awesome, it was literally the best thing in the world and no one could tell me otherwise. Hell I‚Äôve turned down some excellcent job opportunities cause I wasn‚Äôt gonna take a job that drug tests for THC. 
 
It got to the point where I was blowing thru an oz in a week or less by myself and then I did stop for abt a year cause I thought I was gonna get a union position but didn‚Äôt so I started back up again however these days an 8th is lasting me a couple weeks cause I only use my one hitter now, I stopped smoking before work and even on my days off I don‚Äôt tend to wake and bake these days.

Pot just makes me incrediblely anxious and paranoid now. I just sit in my room playing video games silently freaking out abt my life and how it‚Äôs going  nowhere. It has made me incredibly okay with being complacent and that everything will be okay since I‚Äôm still at home with my folks, I don‚Äôt have a thing to worry abt and I am forever grateful to be able to say that, I know many people are not BUT I can‚Äôt stay here forever and they won‚Äôt be around forever. On the other hand  I know that I am naturally not a lazy person, I have a college degree, went to 2 trade schools and going back to school for another associates and then a bachelors. I think that pot has stunted my emotional growth and it has made be okay with doing the bare minimum. 

Everytime I smoke now I just sit in my room and self loathe and I‚Äôm tired of feeling sorry for myself.

I think in order to get to the next level in life so to speak is to put the pot down for a long time, until I get my life going in the path I want it to.

1f2k429,ache,post,leaves_raw_data,"PAWS Progress Report 16months 3weeks 27th August 2024.¬†  
Male - 25 years old  
Casual smoking since 18 years old (2016)  
All day everyday smoke since 2020 and stopped all day everyday smoking on 5th April 2023

Hello,

This is my progress report as of 16months and 3weeks of quitting smoking all day everyday. I'm here to report that sadly I have had a handful of slip-ups that I don't know to count as 'relapse' or not. In the past few months since my progress report which was in May I have taken up weekend smoking and have continued once a week on the weekend smoking since June up to August 18th which was last two weeks.

In the time that I was gone a lot has happened, two of the main things that happened since my last progress report was I've picked up weekend once/twice a week smoking again as well as I travelled overseas and smoked weed and drank till I was passed out drunk at a club overseas.

Before you guys roast me, I know why would I go back to smoking when PAWS gave me absolute hell for 12 months straight and continues to make me uncomfortable up to today. Well to tell you the truth I had 2 objectives in mind when I decided that I would try smoking again. **Objective 1** was to test out the stability of my mind and to see whether smoking will induce a state of panic/extreme anxiety or am I able to enjoy weed like how I used to and **Objective 2** was to test out whether my dopamine as well as endocannabinoid receptors were still fried or not.

**Objective 1**  
Initially I wanted to try smoking to see if my mind was back to normal or whether I would spiral into an anxious mess and initially I was indeed anxious but I soon realised this was more of a self-induced type of anxiousness instead of being anxious for no reason like how we feel during PAWS. It was the thought of being anxious from smoking that made me anxious during the smoking if you know what I mean. As the weeks went on and I continued this once/twice a week smoke sesh with my friends I started to realise I was not so much anxious from smoking but anxious from self induced anxiousness from the overthinking of ""what if I get anxious while smoking"".

Through this I've confirmed that my mind is indeed on it's way back to being normal as I am able to rationalise my anxiety in a way that I couldn't earlier on in my PAWS journey and this gave be a boost of morale that signalled to me that full 100% healing may soon be around the corner.

**Objective 2**  
With objective 2 my main goal was to figure out whether internally were my receptors still fried from the years long abuse or not and to pull this off I had self-experimented with smoking back to back for 2 days straight and to my surprise I would say that my receptors are largely healed but not healed all the way. How did I come to this prognosis that my endocannabinoid as well as dopamine receptors aren't fully healed yet was because in the time that I was away I actually travelled overseas for a short holiday and I went clubbing again for the first time since my PAWS journey started.

This trip for me was crucial in helping me determine that my receptors have indeed largely healed but not all the way as early on in my PAWS journey I could not consume any alcohol at all and any alcohol consumption would lead me to feel extreme anxiety and DP/DR the next day. However during my trip I got blacked out drunk from clubbing and slamming liqour and the next day and though I felt horrible I didn't experience any of my early PAWS psychological symptoms like DP/DR, anxiety, etc. I just felt like how I normally would before PAWS after a night out of heavy drinking which was fatigue and low mood.

**Conclusion**  
To end this progress report and for the sake of putting a number on how I feel overall for those that are curious I would say from my last progress report of 97% healed I would confidently say that I'm at a good 98% to 98.5% healed and the reason for this is because I still have the odd anxiety here and there that has never existed before PAWS but I can feel it melt away ever so slowly.

Granted that there are still situations where I would find myself rather anxious, jittery, intrusive thoughts hitting and constantly checking my heart rate like early on in my PAWS but there are moments where I would fight the anxiousness by facing it straight on and not giving into the anxiety and intrusive thoughts.

As for smoking, I think I'm gonna stop the once/twice a week smoking for now till I'm confident enough to say that I'm 100% healed and whether or not I will indulge in the occasional smoke after I have healed 100% has yet to be decided but I can say that I am grateful for everything that has happened this past 16**¬æ** months as I've learnt a lot about myself and I feel that I actively continue to improve everyday.

To those that are still early on in their PAWS struggle or for those that are deeper in the struggle than me but still continue to feel horrible I'd like to tell you to keep fighting the good fight and have hope that one day it'll all end. I can feel the end of my suffering coming soon and though you may not feel the same way please know that time will heal and eventually this will all be a distant memory.

Thank you to those that read my long progress reports and sincerely thank you for those that have recovered but continue to stay to keep people suffering like me and many others hope that this indeed will end.

All the best my fellow warriors and till next the next progress report ! <3

1f2phej,exhausted,post,weed_raw_data,"THC Break - Help, advice, & support So, I've always been a casual user and mostly just used my vape for recreational opportunities and maybe used it once or twice a month. Earlier this summer, I had a massive injury that kept me in my house and unable to drive for about 8 weeks.  During that time, I started becoming a daily user and would vape every evening to try and help relieve some pain and be able to fall asleep with my new sedentary lifestyle.

I am finally ready to take a THC break for a few months and really just get back to baseline so that I can get back to recreational use only.  However, I am two days in and really struggling. I am not craving to use it but I'm exhausted and unmotivated, the brain fog is making work impossible, I cannot fall asleep at night but all I want to do is sleep during the day. Also, my memory is shit and I can't even communicate correctly....I just omit words when I speak or forget what I'm talking about 4 seconds into my sentence.

I am hoping to just get any advice, helpful tips or tricks, or just general words of support here. ANYTHING to get me through these first two weeks.

I took a 10mg chocolate ediable this friday night at my parents house and haven‚Äôt been the same since. It‚Äôs now been about 2 days basically and i don‚Äôt feel 100% conscious.. nothing feels real and sometimes, i overthink that i had ‚Äúdied‚Äù when i first felt the effects hitting in my bed before i had a really bad trip. I‚Äôm not seeing anything trippy anymore, but i keep hearing loved ones crying faintly in my ear the entire time which has really messed with me. I‚Äôve also been feeling a lot of separation anxiety, especially when my parents would leave or friends i would facetime had to hang up yesterday. At first i was convinced i had passed away in my sleep, by hearing the last video i watched on my phone for hourrrsss and then hearing sirens and loved ones crying obviously. To be noted, this was my first time trying an ediable, or weed basically. Another thing is I just started taking a SSRI ( sertraline ) about a week ago ( september fifth ) which I think could be messing with me more than normal.. if anyone has any advice or some tips, or even some comforting thoughts please leave them below.. i‚Äôm stumped üò≠

edit 1: it‚Äôs sunday night and i just tried to go to bed and got terrible hallucinations that my alarm kept going off and people are crying again. üò≠üò≠ i just wish this would stop

edit 2: frustrating enough, i figured out i wasn‚Äôt hallucinating the phone alarms.. it was my apple watches ‚Äúfind my phone‚Äù button going off (sibling trying to pull a prank on me‚Ä¶ üôÑ). But it‚Äôs still sunday night (basically monday morning) and i‚Äôm having a lot of trouble sleeping. I‚Äôve woken up twice with my heart racing, thinking i‚Äôve actually died or something, and a nauseous stomach ache‚Ä¶. please tell me it gets better guys :(((( . I don‚Äôt know why my brain keeps trying to convince my conscious that i‚Äôm in some kinda ‚Äúcoma‚Äù or something and that none of this is real. Also tmi‚Ä¶ but i think it‚Äôs necessary.. because i‚Äôve been so nauseous for days i‚Äôve had diarrhea since and it‚Äôs been like‚Ä¶ dark green stool and neon green pee.. is that normal ???? üò≠

edit 3: it‚Äôs day 4 and i‚Äôm finally feeling a little less disoriented during the day, however i slept like shit last night because of the anxiety and heart racing stuff. i‚Äôve had to have a friend facetime me all night to help me feel less alone and that really helped ( especially with the separation anxiety i had been dealing with since the first night )

edit 4: night 4 (basically day 5) it‚Äôs so hard to sleep and all i wanna do is just sleep normally but i can‚Äôt üò≠üò≠üò≠. it‚Äôs 4am right now and i just woke up 10 minutes ago hallucinating auditory stuff again (family crying) worse than i was last night. i was shaking shivering even though i wasn‚Äôt cold, heart racing with a burning sensation. basically waking up every hour. i have never had issues with sleep before :(

edit 5 !!! : it‚Äôs officially been 13 days since the first night and i can say i feel much better now. the sleep thing is still somewhat an issue but not as extreme. i‚Äôm now a super light sleeper, when before i had been a deep sleeper.. sometimes i wake up with that awful disoriented, nauseous, shaking feeling, but i‚Äôve somehow been able to lessen it before it gets worse. also, i did admit myself into the hospital because it got unbearable at one point and they prescribed me sleeping medicine (hydroxyzine pamoate 25mg) and that seems to help. although i think i‚Äôm still pretty traumatized from that night, it has gotten better day to day. i finally went back to work and oddly enough that helped me get out of the dissociation state i was in !! for days i was 99% convinced that i had actually died or was in a coma for some reason, and looking up on reddit and google for any advice or reason definitely led me to think deeper on this for some reason. long story short if you‚Äôre dealing with something like what i did, don‚Äôt worry !!! it will get better, you just need to stay calm and be patient (and if you can PLEASSEEEE get some sleep, not sleeping only makes it worse). but thank you all for the helpful advice on here, i was really going through it

Im in an intense program that requires 12 hour shift days and on top of that i work night shift. Recently the weed has gotten to me. It makes me anxious any time i smoke, my heart races and i get palpitations for hours. Its impacting my sleep because i can just feel my heart pounding which increases my anxiety which makes me unable to sleep and i have very important things that ive been missing because of this vicious cycle. I finally came out of denial that the weed was the cause of my problems, or atleast amplifies my problems, when i smoked at 11am yesterday and my symptoms got so much worse and my hunger i was feeling stopped and food sounded revolting. I havent smoked since then and my heart rate has normalized, my anxiety has improved and while im not eating as much as id like, i have many liquid meal equivalents to help me through this week. 

I have to go on a leave of absence for work so i can transfer out of nights as the stress of that isnt helping. My doctors are also giving me trazodone for sleep and prozac for anxiety. Im hoping these will help me through the worst of the weed withdrawals. For people in a longer term t break, when did your appetite and sleep improve. I know sleep is one of the last things to improve but hopefully the trazodone will help. It did last night but i still had some trouble getting to sleep so im hoping if i take two (dr recommended this) itll knock me out and i can keep taking that as needed for important days. 

Any advice for managing withdrawals while still going about my daily life? I want to fully reset my system before attempting to moderate. Or atleast stop smoking while im in school. Thank you guys!!

1fsugsv,wide awake,post,petioles_raw_data,"Anyone else autistic? What's your experience been? Autistic, 27M here. I've been a daily smoker since around 20. Got into it in college for fun, realized ""oh wow this quiets my brain down, makes me less anxious, especially in social situations, and is helping the insomnia I've had since I was a child"" I'm a bit older now and I'm re-evaluating my relationship with cannabis and want to not be reliant on it daily anymore or spending so much money on it. Set some rules (weekends only, have to have my shit for the day done, can't just sit on my phone and veg out after, absolutely no vapes, never before work, no wake and bake etc) and I'm doing well keeping to it except for one area.

Sleep. I know that long term cannabis has a negative impact on the quality of our sleep, and I have been using it as a sleep aid, even in the times I cut down I still always had a little puff before bed. Trying not to do that anymore, even on the days I do let myself smoke. But good god my brain is so loud, and I hear every little thing. I had to shut my window cause every little car noise outside was bothering me. I could hear my roommate at the opposite end of the apartment doing totally normal activities like it was right next to my bed. Also struggling with rumination, overanalyzing everything. I hit the point in the night where I said I could have a little smoke if I was still wide awake, and it finally got me calmed down enough to sleep.

It's tough because I've been able to use other coping mechanisms for things that I used weed to help me with. Changed jobs to have less stress, working thru my social anxiety, I use ashwaghanda and CBD to help with some of that too. I enjoy how I feel during the day on less weed but night time is just fucked.

I see other people say you just have to get through and sleep will be easier. I also know that not everyone is autistic, and aren't necessarily dealing with an extremely loud brain that notices every bit of sensory input around it. 

How have other autistic people here dealt with this? Am I fucked?

I did try googling but every time I get overwhelmed or end up with more questions instead of any answers. Also politely asking to please skip any advice for sleep not related to cannabis - I promise I‚Äôve tried everything I can that‚Äôs within my control!

My main question is whether or not it‚Äôs ok/normal to take it every night for sleep, and what can I expect tolerance-wise? 

It seems like 10mg gummies are a reliable dosage for me to get to sleep, which seems a lot for someone new to them. I was surprised by this because I‚Äôve never smoked or taken edibles before. Should I expect to keep upping my dose in the future unless I take regular tolerance breaks? Are there any negatives to watch out for in general if I‚Äôm taking it every night? Given how much it‚Äôs been helping with sleep I‚Äôm worried there will be a point where I have to stop taking it for whatever reason, which has happened with previous sleep meds. The Reddit threads about quitting cannabis that I inevitably encounter when googling for answers have given me pause. 

If I decide to take a non-sleep-inducing edible during the day, should I change what I do at bedtime? 

And this is something I spent a good amount of time on Google for, but would like personal recommendations too: are there any combinations or ratios of certain cannabinoids to THC that you recommend for sleep and/or nighttime anxiety? I‚Äôve tried edibles with CBD, CBG, CBN, and RSO gummies (which I still don‚Äôt fully know what that is lol). Do you find the cannabinoids make a significant impact? Or if they affect tolerance? Are any a gimmick do you think? 

The most effective I‚Äôve taken so far was Camino sours deep sleep - 10mg (not the usual 5mg sleep ones) plus 10mg cbd and 10mg cbn. but it‚Äôs difficult to find and I can‚Äôt even buy it in my state apparently (MD). Any recommendations for a similar product? I also like the Wyld sleep gummies.

The only good thing about it is it stops my stomach pain, even after all these years all day everyday.

I'm somewhat convinced I was having withdrawals and thats what was causing the stomach pain.

1g4kwp9,wide awake,post,petioles_raw_data,"Waking up to smoke, every night. Hello friends,

Long time smoker, first time poster. Been smoking daily for 12+ years. Small tbreaks, rarely, maybe 2x per year? Last time I took a break was 7 days when I went out of state to a non tree friendly state and decided not to risk it. My sleep suffered immensely, I woke every night drenched in sweat.

Anyway, for about a year now I wake several times a night and can't go back to sleep. An average example: go to bed at 10pm, fall asleep hard and pretty fast, but I'll wake again somewhere between 1130 and 1230. Usually my body feels restless and my mind flying. I tell myself I don't need to smoke in the middle of the night, but usually after trying to fall back asleep for over an hour I'll cave, have a bowl, and back asleep within 30 min. And normally, I'll awake a second time somewhere around  3 to 5 am. Again wide awake, again way too in my head. I have to justify to myself whether to have a second bowl of the night or not. I work at 7 so I try to give myself a buffer window of 2 hours before working so I'm not super out of it.

The whole situation is stressing me the fuck out. I can't sleep normally anymore, I sweat bullets when I abstain, I feel super guilty about waking several times a night to hit a bong so I can sleep again.

1g9a0p5,feels like I'm dying,post,petioles_raw_data,"I get anxious almost every time I get high, what should I do? Just came across this sub for the first time. Sorry for long post. TLDR; tips on mitigating anxiety and weed? Any kinds of THC that I should be looking for more (delta 8, 10, etc)? CBD? I understand quitting would help but the times I get high and I'm not anxious or I'm able to move past it, I still really enjoy it, so looking for advice on how (or if) I still can.

I consider myself a fairly regular user, not every day but a few times a week at most. I try not to get high for multiple days in a row, and sometimes I'll go like a week before getting high again. An issue that's come up kinda recently though is that I have been getting really anxious while high, and even when I'm sober. It's worse when I take edibles so I've been smoking more, but I still get anxious smoking. I've dealt with a lot of mental health issues in my life but anxiety was honestly never at the forefront, it was there for sure but not as bad as most people I know.

But this summer I have had multiple high panic attacks, some while sober, and just generally feeling a LOT more anxiety. I got prescribed anxiety meds for the first time and it definitely helps my day to day, but when I get high it's a lot harder to cope. Almost every time I get high, I feel anxious that I've smoked too much, or took too much of an edible, and that I'm going to randomly faint (which happens when I'm high OR sober, moreso when I'm high, it's been a problem my whole life and idk what specifically causes it, yes I plan on seeing a doctor about it). The fear of fainting is honestly the biggest thing. It has been terrifying and awful every time, sometimes feels like I'm dying for an extended period of time. And I especially don't want to faint in front of people cause I am socially anxious, lol. I often use in social settings (where it's appropriate) like parties or raves or live shows, because alcohol tends to make me feel too sick to feel worth it.

I will take literally any suggestions on what I can do to mitigate this, I consider myself a pretty new user (started using consistently only like a year and a half ago) so I feel like there is a lot left for me to learn about this stuff. I have so much respect for people who are in the process of quitting/have quit, but I don't think I want to do that just yet. It's pretty much the only substance I use, especially socially, and I still can and do have a great time with it if I can just figure out the anxiety thing. I do have a fairly okay relationship with it, I feel like I have finally gotten out of my dependency on it more or less...Still working on it but DEFINITELY an improvement these last few months, and it gets easier as times goes on. I'm at least not using multiple times a day anymore, and not getting as high. Maybe this all sounds like massive coping though and I should definitely quit, for mental AND physical health. I'm worried that I've already messed myself up a bit with the amount I've smoked and being under 25, and that it's the reason why I suddenly have such bad anxiety. I know people have done waay more and earlier but I'm just a bit paranoid about it. Any advice or even just general thoughts and shared experiences would be super appreciated. Thanks for reading if you did. :)

edit: ok yeah I know I know I could just stop. That is a fair suggestion and I guess also what I asked about so should have expected. But like. I still enjoy being high sometimes. It is still fun when I am not anxious. Clearly looking for a little more than ""just stop"".

Hi guys here to ask for some advice on smoking 

For about 9 months now I‚Äôve been smoking pretty regularly, almost daily. 

I‚Äôm at university and I love to hit my bong or go and smoke a joint to relax and unwind. It really helps me sleep and I just love the routine and the feeling of being high, no worries or anxiety just vibes and munchies.

However I know smoking daily is not the best. I would say I go through about 0.2-0.5 grams on a given day. My tolerance since I began however is through the roof and it means I‚Äôm having to spend more and more on bud and it‚Äôs getting expensive.

Just wanted to share my experience yesterday as a lesson.

I am not a regular smoker. I have smoked occasionally with friends but never alone and never got too high. I quite liked the feeling it gives me. Today I tried to smoke myself, and used about half a gram in a joint (which is definitely way too much).

I was smoking it while sitting outside and didn't feel it right away. So, as the classic mistake goes: I kept smoking the rest of the whole joint. It was when I finished up and went back inside that I realized I f-ed up. It suddenly just kicked in and it felt extremely unpleasant. My vision turned into stopmotion, like I was snapping screenshots of what I was looking at, and turning my head felt super strange.

I laid on the couch and closed my eyes and just tried to relax but I started having literal hallucinations. I would become dizzy, see shapes and colors turning into objects, but it would go away when I opened my eyes again. I also noticed that touching my hair felt really weird. I couldn't process that I was touching my hair so it felt like somebody else was touching me, and that made me feel really freaked out. I could also feel my heart pounding in my chest and every heartbeat would shake my whole upper body.

I realized that I had definitely smoked too much, and I went outside to get some fresh air. I then proceeded to sit on the ground in my backyard for 2+ hours, with music on. 

During this time I would feel nauseous and wrong for several minutes, then I would sort of 'sober up' for a few minutes, before returning to nausea and anxiety again. This went on for the entire time. Only about 2-2.5 hours later I started feeling clearer again and I didn't have the trippy feelings anymore. I was able to power through it by just talking to myself, how this is just a plant and a temporary feeling in my head. Thankfully I didn't throw up or pass out outside.

I went back inside, ate some grapes and drank some juice, and I gradually felt better. I eventually was able to fall asleep and the day after I was fine.

I am going to stay away from weed for a bit...",1,training_candidate,0

gyvozum,racing heart,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"When I'm going through withdrawal melatonin gives me horrible nightmares, but I can have it any other time without that effect.

What's helped me with sleep is a combination of L-theanine, zinc, magnesium and either 5htp or L-tryptophan (I get away with less than the recommended dose for all of them).

For the few days I get physical symptoms like hot cold flushes and racing heart I have 1/4-1/2 a B complex vitamin pill and that clears it up for a few hours - the B-vitamins also help a lot with sleep, if I run out of the b complex eating eggs help, just not as much.

During the day green tea, chai tea (with cinnamon) & hot chocolates along with an alpha GPC or choline supplement help a lot. Coffee or to a lesser degree cola makes everything much worse, but could be a PTSD thing because they also negatively effect me when I've been completely weed free for months, strangely(?) they don't negatively effect me when I'm regularly having weed.

CBD is hit and miss, I'm not sure about it yet. Last year I felt like it made withdrawal much worse, but recently when I had a short break after starting the Tryptophan, Theanine & Alpha GPC I don't think CBD was having the same negative effect and might have been helping, I need to try again.

h14qma2,stinging,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"Definitely stop smoking. Honestly, it's a really good time for you to take a break, even if it's just for a week. You need to know how your body actually is before you can begin to heal it. (Breaks are tough, here's some [help](https://complicatedreality.com/blog/eEyj/how-to-fight-the-urge-to-get-high-all-the-time) if you need it.)

After your break, a vape is a much *better* choice, but still maybe not the best. I only say this because I spent a decade figuring out the lowest impact cannabis delivery method I could. The downside to a herb vape is that the vapor is particularly sticky, it clings to your throat and your upper lungs. (Smoke does this too, of course, while also painting everything in a fresh coat of ash. You can see how this could be a problem.) For an individual session, this isn't a big deal.

But the vape high doesn't hit the same as the smoke high, and in particular, it doesn't last as long. That's really nice sometimes, but for most people (myself included) it becomes an excuse to have several sessions a day. Now personally, I don't give a shit if you want to get high ""all day every day"", you do you. But in terms of ""taking care of your lungs"", 3-4 coats a day of sticky vapor isn't great, and your tolerance is going through the roof.

So that leads to dabs. Imagine those cute little pens that you see everyone sucking on? You don't want to use those. Sorry. They are *super* convenient, but to keep the cartridges liquid enough to function, you usually get a pretty thick, terp-y vapor blend that just coats your insides in sticky anguish. Some people are ""in it for the terps"", and that's where all your favorite weed ""flavors"" come from.  But in terms of lung health, vaporized terpenes aren't doing you any favors.

Good luck though, it's cheaper to go without the pens and just get yourself a dab rig.  Once you do, you can get the nice, purified dabs that aren't loaded down with tons of terps. But even here, you have to watch out. You can get a nectar collector, a little tube with a metal straw at one end that you heat up and stick into the dab wax. These work beautifully, except it's way to easy to straight up *burn your lungs* by sucking vapor through a *glowing hot metal straw.* You have to be a real stickler for heating up to just the right temperature, pulling just the right amount, it's a very delicate and obnoxious process.

So the last piece of the puzzle is an electronic-nail. It's a heating coil attached to a metal bowl piece. Through induction, it heats the metal to roughly whatever temperature you set it to. You find a nice spot somewhere between 620F - 675F, let the metal heat up (it only takes a minute) then drop the dab (using a metal dab tool) onto the hot bowl, causing it to vaporize and get sucked through the rig. With this you don't risk burning your lungs as much, it's allows for water cooling (like a bong), and you can take a single, easy hit.

It will kick about as strong as a joint, but only lasts for 2-3 hours. But instead of 3-6 pulls from a joint, you only need a single dab hit at a time. In once, out once, you're good to go. As an added bonus, if you make a habit of flipping your e-nail back off, it really helps you convince yourself not to just sit and keep hitting it.

he8ockh,spiraling,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"I suffered from crippling depression for a long time. I would have good periods too, but depression always won out, to the point where I couldn't last at any job longer than 3 months because I'd invariably end up in bed for a week or whatever.

My depression was caused by untreated anxiety, which was made really really bad by not sleeping. My anxiety isn't awful, but it's definitely makes it hard to fall asleep, so I had pretty bad insomnia most nights. As long as it didn't happen too many days in a row I was okay, but it just got worse and worse. In my mood 20s, stressful events would combine with my anxiety and I'd walk around super wound up for weeks at a time.

I never really used cannabis back then because I would fall asleep at parties when I got high. But in grad school I moved in with this European dude who would smoke a little every night after dinner. Eventually I started using cannabis the same way, and that changed everything for me. I started sleeping every night, so my anxiety stopped spiraling out of control. And without those crazy highs, I stopped having depression, which 23 year old me would never have believed possible.

8 years later I was diagnosed with type II bipolarity, but I was also in remission. Both psychiatrists I consulted thought it was best to continue using cannabis as a sleep aid instead of trying to find whatever mix of other meds that would get me to the point where I already was. I feel so lucky because I was able to experience 8 years of a happy, stable life before I was ever diagnosed, so it wasn't nearly as scary to hear the labels. It's been 5 years and I'm still doing well.

hwy4x3g,overwhelmed,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"Paranoia and anxiety was what made me stop smoking back in the 90s.  Something in my brain chemistry changed at some point and what used to be a gigglefest devolved into overwhelming fixations on death to the point that I was scared to go to sleep high thinking that I wouldn't wake.  Forget about smoking in social situations.  BLECH!  


What changed for me was the prevalence of Indicas now.  Back in the 70s and 80s, especially, there was only Sativa around.  At least where I was in the States back then, anything Afghan or Thai was exotic as fuck and pure unobtanium.  Indica based ""Skunk"" weed was around in the 90s but by that point I had given up.  


Now that there are far more strain choices I am able to grow and smoke some incredibly potent yet enjoyable Indicas.  Occasionally I'll smoke a near 100% Sativa one of friends have grown and I instantly regret it.

i16n56a,anxiety,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"I will make it simple for you dreadwail, and the rest who deny T-Breaks are needed and who swear cannabis withdrawal is not real. It is real and can be mild to major. I have seen a few have heart rhythm issue.
  

  
Said issues will be made worse due to constant anxiety/panic attacks non-stop for days/weeks, and loss of sleep for weeks that almost caused a family member of mine to almost crash their car.
  

  
You can't even stop the long-term use of OTC drugs without withdrawals. A higher level of withdrawals is found in heavy/long-term users of course.
  

  
ANY drug, such as psychoactive drugs (Like cannabis) yes cannabis is also a drug/drugs that creates addiction, and tolerance due to the wellbeing it gives you. Who would not want to feel fantastic all day long 24/7. Many can't stop getting high 24/7 even if it does nothing for them, the moment they stop they have some unpleasant issues.
  

  
So when misinformed stoners tell other stoners horse crap, that weed/cannabis does not cause withdrawals. ""Oh it must be something else"", or ""It's all in your head"" or ""Oh you have heart issues go to the ER"".
  

  
Normally if someone was made aware its just weed withdrawal and will pass in time. And to use full-spectrum CBD until they finish their T-Break, the anxiety and mental issues they have from being in withdrawal would be much less intense. Their blood pressure goes down, their pulse goes down, and they sleep better.
  

  
Being told they may have a medical issue going and may have heart issues (Heart palpitations), a common withdrawal effect due to THC's effects on the vegas nerve causing it to adjust to body chemistry that lacks THC.
  

  
So many who take a T-Break or quit using cannabis hear that BS, and it ramps anxiety to the max. Their blood pressure is already higher/lower due to loss of the THC as the body adapts to the T-Break/Quitting.
  

  
You are screwing them and others who read such piles of horse crap. They even have vitals that are off and will fuel some hardcore health anxiety being told the biggest line of BS ever ""Weed/Cannabis does not cause withdrawals"".
  

  
Everyone who enjoys cannabis would love to be lit 24/7, but we can't do that. Not without some bad things happening. Your only ways to solve tolerance issues is to use more of said drug/drugs. This creates a biphasic effect and creates issues, as well as causes your body to alter itself to run with such high levels of compounds.
  

  
Many drugs that are not psychoactive create withdrawals even when you stop them, depending on a lot of factors of course.
  

  
But let's focus on one area of psychoactive drugs. Such as the compounds found in cannabis.
  

  
Cannabis use creates a tolerance due to the body responding to the surge in external compounds. This makes the body respond by trying to balance itself out to adapt to the new blood/organ/brain chemistry.
  

  
One way to do this is to limit or turn off the creation of natural body-made compounds, another is to limit the sites these compounds bind to, in an attempt to regulate your body to a better state of homeostasis.
  

  
The human body is very adaptive and changes every second of every single day, and research has shown that some genes in our body became more active after death as they try to adapt to the death of the body.
  

  
So when you halt any drug you put into your body. Your body has to readapt to the blood/body chemistry changes. One way it responds is by growing back these receptors over time and restarting the creation of natural compounds.
  

  
But until you have fully returned to baseline chemistry, your body will not be too happy. Cannabis withdrawal remains mild for many casual users, but it can be pretty bad in those who use it every single day for major pain, mental health, eating disorders and more.
  

  
The bad symptoms you experience are normally found in these areas. (Learning, memory, emotional processing, sleep, temperature control, pain control, inflammatory and immune responses, and eating.)
  

  
They are all systems that are not correctly regulated by the ECS properly due to you having too high of a tolerance, and or taking a T-Break/quitting.

j4qemmj,inflammation,comment,mmj_raw_data,"I can't speak to your specific pain experience, but cannabis is hugely beneficial for inflammation based issues & chronic pain and is MUCH safer than alcohol. When compared side by side, cannabis is the WAY better option and much less risky. If your quality of life is being effected this badly, you absolutely should give it a try. A lot of people find it brings them relief in a way that's much more tolerable and without the side effects and potential addiction of opiate-based prescription pain medication.

That said, today's cannabis strains are bred for the highest THC possible, it's a way different beast than what you may have had years ago, if you partook in the past. I say this because your first couple experiences will involve some experimenting to see what will work for you. Don't get discouraged if the first couple times you find it gets you too stoned to function. As the commercial cannabis market matures, hopefully people will start to understand that cannabis strains with a more well rounded mix of cannabinoids (even at a much lower THC percentage) actually give a way better, more enjoyable experience we'll see a shift to true medicinal strains. But we aren't there yet, so expect to do some mixing and matching and adding CBD and possibly other cannabinoids  to your THC meds to dial them in.

CBD will even out and lessen the psychoactive effects of THC, and also is well known for its inflammation benefits, CBN is helpful for sleep, CBG is good for inflammation, pain, anxiety, and stalling cancer cells (but that one is considered ""new"" in a lot of places and is harder to find.)

Regardless if you start with edibles or flower, I recommend getting some good quality CBD edibles or bud (CBD bud can legally be shipped to all 50 states) to go with your THC product, and always have some on hand. If you ever find that you've gotten uncomfortably stoned, taking CBD will even it out and make you feel a lot more comfortable. I have issues with anxiety and not all highs agree with me, and I've found always having CBD around to be a game changer.  If you're starting with edibles, a 2-5mg THC dose is a good place to start for the average user, 10mg shouldn't be too crazy, and may work better for you since you're taking it for pain, not recreation. But start small. Some people can take 200mg and have a fine day, if I took over 20mg I'd probably end up in the hospital after having a full on existential crisis. Age, weight, height, etc seem to have no correlation with how much you can take, so again, start off small. My partner is a big guy and he usually limits himself to 5mg and it makes him downright goofy. You need to take it with a bit of a fat so it can dissolve, and it could take up to an hour or two before you feel anything. Always start slow, the joke is people say the edible won't start working until you complain that it's not doing anything and take more, and then you're spending the rest of the day on the couch. A 1:1 CBD:THC ratio will offset a lot of the psychoactive effects and you'll probably be somewhere between just being in a very pleasant mood to being slightly stoned but able to pull it together enough to function around other people. A 2:1 CBD:THC would probably be a good ratio for work, but of course, test this theory first after work. If you're in a legal market, there's a good chance you can find 20:1 CBD ratios, CBN, and CBG varieties too. We go in and stock up on everything that sounds good when it's on sale and then just cut gummies in half if needed to get to a dosage that has exactly what we want in it.

You may find that regular edibles just don't cut it for your pain issues, in which case you may want to try something even more robust, like RSO, but definitely get some experience with ingesting THC and figuring out how your body reacts before you try that. It's like the difference between a beer and a whole bottle of whiskey.

If you choose to smoke it, you'll of course get instant feedback. You can always mix CBD weed with your THC strains if you're worried about getting too stoned. If smoking works better for you than edibles, long term, I'd look at dry herb vaporizers so you're not inhaling combustibles. You'll find you get less congestion and this way and it's undoubtedly healthier, though we don't have a lot of studies to prove it yet. A great, inexpensive vaporizer is the Dynavap, but brand new users may find a battery powered option easier. You could also go with vaping carts, but I tend to find that those irritate my throat and cause congestion the next day and dry herb vaping does not. The r/vaporents subreddit will have tons of info if you want to go down that path.

There's also THC/CBD transdermal patches, creams, and other topical products that may bring relief or a be a good supplement to have on hand at work that won't get you fucked up. If you're in a legal market, or in driving distance to one, try to find a dispensary that carries a lot of medical products and talk to an experienced bud tender. (Dispos that have knowledgeable people for chronic pain will probably carry a larger variety of alternate cannabinoid products, so you'll see listings on weedmaps/leafly for CBD, CBN, CBG, RSO, etc.)

Not a doctor or bud tender, I just work tangentially in the field as a product photographer so I get to see all the new stuff that comes in. Sorry for the novel, but if you're taking this for a pain issue, you should have as much info as possible. I really hope cannabis works for you, it's a much better option than alcohol or opiates!",1,training_candidate,1

Here‚Äôs what I can tell you, increased paranoia when discontinuing use is not common and is not expected. Some people end up self-medicating anxiety and/paranoia via cannabis, and when they stop their mental health symptoms increase. This sounds like what you might be experiencing. 

I think it‚Äôs a good idea that you see a psychiatrist and a therapist, as soon as you can. There are some great medications for anxiety that aren‚Äôt habit forming like benzodiazepines. Anxiety to the point of paranoia is really uncomfortable and potentially destabilizing, so I would encourage you to try various methods to calm your mind. CBD softgels (I‚Äôd recommend 100mg-200mg) can help as they‚Äôre very relaxing at that dose, at night Benadryl can both help you sleep and it has an anxiolytic effect that can help the following morning, Insight Timer is an amazing free app for meditation (I recommend Tara Brach she is great with emotional discomfort), and the app ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Up?‚Äù is also a free app with a ton of helpful resources with no ads (Insight Timer is also ad free).

jl3ah5c,always tired,comment,mmj_raw_data,"Are you ADHD? I am, and was misdiagnosed for about a decade. ADHD patients are often anxious and depressed due to their symptoms. *Most* people have the opposite experiences with indicas than you. They are known as the typical downers, and sativas as the uppers, due to the most common terpene profiles among the most common strains. But there are almost countless factors that affect the terpene profile of an individual plant, like lineage, how it is grown, how it is dried, how it is cured, if it was a exposed to contaminates, etc.

This is why learning your personal terpene profile is an excellent way to learn to medicate with cannabis. Saying a strain is a ‚Äúsativa‚Äù or ‚Äúindica‚Äù is a figure of speech 99.99% of the time at a dispo. Nearly everything sold legally is technically a hybrid now, and all states with any legalization require testing at dispos *for each harvest*, and require those test results be available at those same dispos. You can always request it, even though many budtenders aren‚Äôt even aware of the existence of terpenes. They will usually offer a percentage when you ask, but you can legally request the specific, *exact* terpene test results for *that specific harvest,* which is very important when medicating. 

ADHD patients have a dopamine deficiency which causes us to seek out novel stimulation in new activities, which is often expressed as a low attention span. This is can be mentally taxing, which can lead to fatigue. So indicas, which are known to relieve stress by causing a sleepy, body high, actually stress me out.  I‚Äôm always tired. I need something to *pep me up,* because my anxiety and depression are often linked with a feeling of exhaustion. 

This is why amphetamines are a common medication for us. Many people get *more* anxious when they are that amped up, but it relieves anxiety in ADHD patients, because it gives our brains the dopamine it craves, which actually levels us out instead of making us erratic. I wake up erratic, and even out as my meds kick in. Most people are the opposite, hence my condition being dubbed a ‚Äúmental illness.‚Äù",1,training_candidate,0
jlnjh7x,nervous,comment,mmj_raw_data,"The previous responses are very good. Just a couple of bits I would like to share. First I have been on Wellbutrin ( Bupropion) for twenty years   for depression  but helps more now with ADHD. Started cannabis use 6 years ago and it was a life saver particularly at times the antidepressant seemed to work in reverse. Consult a good unbiased doctor and study how terpenes effect the high which is more important than sativa or indica before trying again. Cannabis used without negative results DOES NOT indicate you have overcome your mental health issues. Also, using flower, oil pen vapes, and tinctures  under the tongue are not processed in the liver but go directly to the receptors. However a change in the nervous system can effect drug efficacy. Edibles do really interact because the cannabinoids are metabolized in the liver. Lastly, I hate to discourage and disappoint you but if you are using cannabis and fail drug tests the military will make you get clean or they won‚Äôt accept you.

k82k449,migraine,comment,mmj_raw_data,"I never suffered until I had cancer surgery that destroyed a bunch of nerves in my forehead and scalp.  Weed is awesome for migraines,  but is strain specific.   Sativas seems to work best (paradise waits from Trulieve was primo for this), but a couple other sativas and hybrids also worked well.  My migraines always started with a severe nerve pain, and a quick puff of the right flower would slow down the progression to a migraine, and a homemade edible taken after the puff worked for hours or completely gone.  Strain specific RSO makes superb edibles.  When the headaches were constant initially,  I took RSO capsules 3 times a day, but my tolerance got way too high.

ka1gznz,anxiety,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"If that's not a physical health issue like something cardiovascular or circulatory, it sounds like it could simply be panic related.

It can be truly debilitating, knock you out of what you're trying to do, and then focusing on sensations can amplify them. That's the spiral.",1,training_candidate,1
ks3if44,racing heart,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,I made a batch of cookies yesterday and used 14g of skunk  that's ok strength wise (illegal so I don't really notice the names) and 14g of Thai/brick weed.   The skunk brings the strength and  whilst the Thai brings some THC it also brings all the cannabinoids bred out of the skunk.  Each cookie has 0.43g of the Skunk/Thai mix I'm guessing about 30-35mg.   The hit is lovely and smooth with no anxiety and it's now my standard way of making my edibles.  I find using just the skunk it's all a bit edgy and racing heart to really enjoy the ride.,1,training_candidate,1

It could be an option for people who like cannabis but not the heart pounding especially since metoprolol is quite weak and really only does what it needs to do.

Prior to the beta blocker my heart rate would instantly skyrocket to 150bpm+ after finishing a bowl or dab or coming up fully on a 10mg gummy. My guess was the cannabis tachycardia was amplified by my chronic illness POTS. My theory behind why is pots has reflex tachycardia due to the posture change.

l3tnwu3,shortness of breath,comment,mmj_raw_data,"It's interesting how cannabis affects everyone differently!

l51rdsu,discomfort,comment,treedibles_raw_data,"There‚Äôs no magic number or even a range of THC for anyone to consume. I could eat 500mg and feel less than you who ate 5mg, or vice versa, as it‚Äôs all processed in the liver before entering bloodstream with oral consumption. Some people even completely lack the liver enzymes responsible for metabolizing THC and thus they only get a very very small percentage of THC into the bloodstream that makes it through unchanged. These are the people you‚Äôll see that say things like they ate 500mg of THC with little to no effect. 

We all fall somewhere on a spectrum from hyper efficient metabolizers to zero metabolization  at all. Most people fall somewhere in the middle, but that‚Äôs a wide wide range. Some people, even individuals with large inhaled tolerances can still get schwacked off as little as 5-10mg. Some without any tolerance could eat as little as a mg and get fairly stoned their first few times. 

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always advised to start with a 5mg dose and see how that goes for you before treading deeper. If you don‚Äôt feel 5mg at all, you could then try 15-20mg, if you felt it but wasn‚Äôt strong enough I‚Äôd just bump to 10mg. Then just keep titrating up or down from that point. That‚Äôs the safe ‚Äúmedicinal‚Äù way of increasing a dose of oral THC. 

You may find you need 100mg+ or you may feel you only need 5mg hard to say, like I said for some it can start to become fairly psychoactive even sub 5mg in rare users or fresh to THC users. There‚Äôs a cross tolerance to inhaled THC, but it‚Äôs not a 1:1 thing due to oral THC mainly metabolizing into other liver breakdown metabolites that have a cross tolerance with D9 THC, but it‚Äôs not a direct translation that you can take a whole lot from most the time. Like if you smoke like 50mg of THC a day you could likely take 10-20mg instead of 5mg and it would be similar, but that‚Äôs just me coming up with an educated rough guesstimate. 

Then it all depends on whether THC even helps with your pain or not. For some individuals, like myself THC increases the pain I feel above a certain dose. It makes my mind focus more on the pain which in turn just adds to the discomfort, others swear by it for pain. 

Personally I‚Äôve found success with it for pain, but only as a minor component of a full spectrum product such as a CBD/CBG/CBC based product. I‚Äôve gotten amazing effects from buying and making at home RSO/ oil infusions utilizing hemp flower and various other minor cannabinoids where THC levels are much lower and only add a background effect to the rest. I‚Äôve personally found doing like 50-200mg CBD/25mg CBG/ 5-10mg CBC/5-10mg THC to be around the sweet spot I like. I do this by buying middle of the road CBD hemp flower, at least cannabinoid wise, so around 15:1-40:1 CBD to THC, and then adding in CBG and CBC distillate as desired. 

CBG is the magic ticket for pain for myself, just have to be careful as too much of it can make me jittery like a big cup of coffee type of feeling. Just the right amount does absolute wonders when mixed with a high CBD/low THC oral product. And CBC is straight magic, it has made every other cannabinoid I‚Äôve consumed it with feel more potent and effective, and this includes THC. 

If I could recommend a product from a great overall vendor/breeder check out the full spectrum distillate from high alpine genetics, about 35 shipped for a 5grams syringe and contains a great mix of high CBD with moderate amounts of THC:CBG:CBC and trace amounts of some other helpful cannabinoids such as the varins aka THCV/CBDV. Then you could mix this with some high THC RSO or whatever other form of THC you‚Äôd like to increase the more pronounced psychoactive effects as desired. 

Most medical/recreational dispensaries don‚Äôt typically carry a ton of products that are anything other than high THC with trace CBG and microscopic amounts of anything else it may have. They‚Äôve gotten better over the last 2-3 years in my experience, but it‚Äôs still nowhere near as effective as mixing hemp based products with marijuana products. Also they charge a pretty high premium for them compared to buying the two separately. In some states like my own a lot of the mixed products put out they‚Äôre literally doing what I‚Äôve described. They‚Äôre allowed to buy bulk CBD isolate/distillate/flower along with bulk minor cannabinoids from the hemp industry and then mix it with their high THC products to make their mixed ratio oral offerings. Then add on a large premium for the convenience. 

They don‚Äôt like growing a lot of the more medicinal strains of cannabis as they don‚Äôt sell as well as all the 20-35% THC strains do which rarely contain even 1-2% total of all other cannabinoids combined. Average high THC marijuana has a THC:CBD ratio of over 200:1, aka near non existent. They‚Äôll just have the typical .3-1% total CBG and that‚Äôs about it 80-90% of  the time.

An old friend of mine had to have one of his legs amputated below the knee, and he literally opened a cabinet with three shelves of pills, and said that Cherry Pie in his vaporizer replaced all of those pain meds. Thankfully, my pain is indirect and very manageable -- but I have an idea of the kind of just mental toll that chronic pain can take on a person. A lot of times I feel like I have someone poking me with their finger in random parts of my body about once a second, and after a few hours it absolutely puts me on edge. I can't quite fathom how generally anxious I'd be if it were really painful. Damn. 

If you are at all able to grow, I can't recommend this highly enough. I can spit out a half-pound of *chef's kiss* Jack Herer in four months in my basement for about $80. It's an investment, and you have to have the living situation to be able to do it, but if you can even grow one or two plants, it could be a big help. In my state (OK), you can also apply for a ""caregiver"" license in order to grow for someone else. Maybe something like that is a possibility in your state. 

The other thing you might think about is getting a dynavap. I literally use about 50% as much weed as when I was smoking. I literally laugh at how little cannabis can be effective in these things. It could be a huge savings for you.

There‚Äôs a few studies on this phenomenon, but there seems to be a link between heavy usage in your adolescence and THC eventually causing anxiety. Literally only one of the 15+ stoners I hung out with still smoke, and Im in my mid 20s. My personal theory is it fucks with your dopamine receptors and how your brain reacts to THC since your brain is still developing. The science isn‚Äôt there yet tho to tell us why.

The year i took off and the month i‚Äôve been sober, my anxiety has always been much easier to manage. I think THC can be a bandaid, and I think like most substances it‚Äôs not a good coping skill. It helps in the moment but makes it worse in the long run. 

I would try playing around with it, reducing usage and how much you‚Äôre consuming when you do smoke. If you do end up quitting, having reduced your usage will make withdrawals a lot easier. 

Everyone is different tho at the end of the day. I just wanted to offer my experience when faced with similar issues. I‚Äôm not saying you have to quit weed by any means, I am still pro weed. But I think just like alcohol or any drug, heavy usage in your youth can change your dynamic with it. I also personally used it to cope with my anxiety and depression, and it bit me in the ass later in life. (Not saying you do this, I don‚Äôt know you or your story)",1,training_candidate,1
ljq0qrc,melatonin,comment,petioles_raw_data,"I've had great experiences with NAC while on a break but holy hell you're taking a lot. 600mg is plenty for me.¬†


My NAC observations:
1.) Doesn't do anything good at all unless I've already been sober for at least a few days (I take melatonin &/or tryptophan to help sleep those first few days).


2.) Makes me wired. I get up earlier and I sleep less. Most importantly though, I get tired in the evening and want to go to sleep earlier (unlike stimulants).


3.) Cuts cravings.


4.) I had the best effect from NAC Sustain by Jarrow, but regular NAC also had a good effect, as did NAC ethyl ester. Best taken in the morning on an empty stomach.


5.) The energy seems to wear off after a couple months. I think NAC just accelerates a sort of rebound effect I get when quitting.¬†


Side effects:


1.) Sometimes increased irritability. This has caused me to lower the dose before.


2.) NAC has mucalytic properties (it decreases mucus). This is good if you have bronchitis or COPD, but awful for a healthy person. Dries out my nose and mouth and throat and I think it can make it more likely to catch a virus. Decreasing gut mucus can lead to damage of the gut barrier/stomach lining. This is the worst side effect by far for me and I will start to get bad acid reflux if I continue very long. I haven't found a way around it.",1,training_candidate,0

It is less than ideal to use the Melatonin hormone to supplement with long term, or even more than a week. There‚Äôs a lot that goes into fixing our modern day sleep problems. Do you drink caffeine?

Taking 3 months off and reassessing is going to be my next goal. 

I do love many aspects of cannabis, I just think I'd be better not having this dependency on it. I know moderation can be difficult to achieve though. I've  gotten to points in the past where I have loved the freedom of not caring if I can't get any, instead of stressing about what I'll do without it. Once I start smoking again though, I can't seem to stop until I tell myself I'm taking a break. 

I definitely need something for pain management. Exercise has been excellent but pain flares still happen, and that impacts my mental health more than anything. I've worked so hard to rehabilitate myself physically after an eating disorder and injuries, and movement helps my anxiety a lot. I just get so miserable when this happens, so weed becomes the crutch. 
I've discussed it with a doctor since writing this post and they've actually recommended CBD so I can see if that helps. Her advice was to increase CBD to reduce my THC usage. 

I recently quit nicotine as well, so I'm trying to not go too hard on myself by quitting everything all at once.

lkwwi6o,panic,comment,petioles_raw_data,"Okay so you might be onto something, as DHV vaporizes different can cannabinoids at different temperatures.

But maybe whatever temperature you're vaporizing at is avoiding whatever cannabinoid is causing panic issues (likely CBG or THCv). Of course it could be the CBN as CBN does feel lightly dissociating and relaxing but it's usually very anxiolytic. 

I'd suggest checking the lab test for your flower and seeing what it's high in. If it's got some THCv or CBG in there I'd say that's probably what's going on.",1,training_candidate,0

Of course we played with it for recreation at first, but I personally don't enjoy it that much. It's hard to dose edibles so that it's not too overwhelming for me.

First as a teacher (with adhd who works with kids with ‚Äúmild‚Äù disabilities like adhd) I‚Äôm super proud of you for being able to identify that this is a life change that needs to happen. It‚Äôs really hard to do when you‚Äôre so young so you are already one step in the right direction.

For me, cutting tobacco completely out of my weed made it soooo much easier to limit my weed usage. Especially with adhd, the effect of nicotine is hugely effective for dopamine, which is why it‚Äôs so addicting. So first things first, start only smoking weed. No tobacco.

Then focus on only smoking weed at certain times or for a certain amount each week. When you feel yourself spiraling, try this technique: tense your whole body for 15 seconds, then release. Continue to do so until you feel a sense of calm. Get a good weighted blanket. Call a trusted friend or family member. If you can, you can try a journaling app to write (I know this is hard with adhd). Try exercising right where you are (look up couch exercises!!)

As you get less and less dependent on the tobacco and weed, you will start to get better sleep. Your appetite will get better. You‚Äôll still want to scratch the dopamine itch but will find other things that do it for you. Aaaand you‚Äôll be able to tell if vyvanse is actually the right med (or dosage) for you.

Today is 18 days without weed for me. If it's possible for me, it's possible for you. What changed for me this time is I finally started listening to that inner voice and was willing to go through whatever discomfort I needed to achieve it. I've been wanting to quit for years and I've taken several short breaks before I relapsed, but I've never made it this long.

The real benefits come after breaks longer than a few days. I'm only recently starting to feel **really damn good**. I haven't slept this well since I was a child. I'm having dreams again and I wake up well rested every day. It feels absolutely incredible. I have a little anxiety and some mood swings here and there, but they aren't as intense. I know I'll eventually smoke again, but if you're serious about changing your life, the perspective to change it won't really come until you build the courage to take a longer break. I don't want to lose my dreams and this sleep habit again, and I'm starting to flirt with the idea of extending my 30 day break to 60 days or more. If you would've asked me within that first 5 days if that's something I'd do, I would've told you you're crazy.

If you only hold off until this weekend, you'll get the worst of the withdrawals with little of the benefits, so it reinforces the trap that you're in. If holding off until this weekend is the best you can do, that's perfectly fine, but use it as a stepping stone and a confidence builder towards a 3 week or longer break so you can experience the hope, optimism, and improving clarity I currently do.

I downloaded the app ""Quit Weed"" that's really been helpful for me. There are other apps, but what I've really responded to about this one is that it helps break down the symptoms and gives me estimates for when they will go away.

lqk7xoe,nervous,comment,cbd_raw_data,"look into CBD with CBN instead thc.

THC will help you short-term with your anxiety and pain but over time the quality of your sleep will be detrimentally affected due to the fact that THC lowers REM. Which REM is very important for mental health and over all well being. I like using indica leaning THC gummies When I absolutely need it but I have found other cannabinoids that can do the better job without exacerbating anxiety and effecting REM long term. 

CBD is great as a gummy or a tincture because it doesn't affect REM and you get all the benefits without the psychoactive component. You get tons of anxiety relief, stress relief, inflammation relief, and just a great sense of well-being.

Also CBN is one of the best cannabinoids that I have found for anxiety disorders. CBN is the most sedating cannabinoid and helps dramatically with insomnia disorders. I have found that CBN is more potent than CBD when it comes to anxiety relief. CBN has heavy relaxing effects on the muscles and nervous system so you feel literally the tension melt away. CBD is great still no doubt about it but CBN is definitely going to give more relief in my experience.

So what I'll usually do is I'll take a CBD tincture throughout the day to help my anxiety. This stabilizes the parasympathetic system and allows My body not to be in a cortisol high state.

Once it's closer the evening I take a CBN+CBD deep sleep gummy by herbal garden essentials which also has L-theanine and melatonin. All of these compounds mixed together in the gummy gives me incredible anxiety relief and I sleep amazing. I noticed ever since I started using the CBN+CBD that my anxiety the next day is absolutely at its lowest. It really allows my body to sink in deep relaxation which allows the nervous system to recover so it feels fresh to encounter the daily stresses of life the next day.

THC absolutely has a role but in very small amounts. You don't need too much of it. And to pinpoint the exact dose that you need for anxiety is a hit or mess. And sometimes even when you nail down the dose you'll still get random bouts of anxiety when taking it.

So I usually just stick to other cannabinoids like CBD and CBN because it's a lot more controllable from my experience and it's consistent in its results.",1,training_candidate,0

lskmpst,anxiety,comment,entwives_raw_data,"I'm so glad our fav plant is making your life better. It did the same for me!

I have multiple health issues with main ones being chronic severe migraines, myofascial pain disorder, IBS and miscl neurological issues such as tremors and muscle spasms and Intermittent speech fluency issues. I also struggle with anxiety and depression. Using medical cannabis has helped every single one of these things to some degree and some almost completely. I was able to get off almost off the meds I was in saving further damage to my kidneys and liver and best of all I got off opiods! I went from a script of up to 40 mg of Norco a day to a script of 1 day for severe pain. I've had the same bottle for two years and I have several in it! Huge!

I've tried most ways in consuming and have determined that edibles don't work for me, concentrates and carts don't work as well as flower and they drive my tolerance way up, blending hemp flower in with THC flower is even more effective for pain and inflammation.

My preferred method of consuming flower is via a vaporizer although I'll do a bong rip or joint if the occasion arises.  There's also something nice about the ritual of preparing flower; the opening the weed storage bags and getting that lovely whiff of plant, the grinding, the packing the chamber, the device cleaning. I often pre pack the day's doses in pods I can store in a sealed container then just slip into my vapirizor when it's session time.

I will use a cart when the dispo has a strain I really want and it's only available in cart or when I'm in a huge hurry or when I'm traveling. I avoid them if I can to keep my tolerance low.

When I first started I was just short of 64 yrs old! I was experiencing serious grief and so much physical pain. Within a year I was living again. I have pain but it is nothing like it was. IBS is still am issue but the pain associated with it is minimal and relapses are not as severe. Depression is not there nor is anxiety most of the time.

lt91t6y,paranoia,comment,petioles_raw_data,"Oof! That says it all right there. ""Find whatever was strongest""... Bad idea. In my decades long experience, we have lost A LOT by breeding this plant for THC and only THC. THC is only one piece in a puzzle we won't fully understand for decades. 

Only those of us who smoked before legalization remember what it used to be like. Man do I miss ""middies"". Modern weed gives me a headache and it is by no means unrelated to the higher THC, lower CBD strains and products that we get nowadays. Honestly I am considering growing as I write this just to get some milder stuff. 

Find a more balanced strain. Something around 10% THC and 10% CBD. Start there.

Each time it happens it ALWAYS ends up going away and I enjoy the high when it passes but in the moment it feels horrible. One thing that has really helped me is taking cbd pills for a few days before using Marijuana, it help the Marijuana not to be as much of a '""shock to the system.""

CBD is great throughout the day because it will help manage the withdrawal effects that you can get from THC. Will help things anxiety for sure

And at night the CBN is the best! I notice that my anxiety is absolutely non-existent and I got some amazing sleep. The problem with THC is that it interferes with REM so long-term wise your sleep quality goes to shit.

With CBN it actually increases REM and the quality and quantity of sleep you get is so restorative.

I'll use my CBD tincture from Charlotte's Web throughout the day

And then I'll use my CBN+CBD deep sleep gummies and tincture from herbal garden essentials. The gummies also have L-theanine and melatonin in them So it helps a lot with anxiety and insomnia. The tincture is also great because It will last you two to three months.

Your habit is a teenager. Mine can buy a drink. It's gonna take A LOT of effort to change who these habits are given how established they are. 

For me, I have had zero success until this year. This is mostly due to the fact I tried quitting cold turkey. It never worked for me. I would ALWAYS rebound given the things you've said, terrible withdrawals and no sleep. 

My advice is end the addictive behavior first vlby eliminating the ""feel bad, must smoke"" cycle we all get trapped in. Don't smoke at all unless it is absolutely necessary right before bed to sleep. Otherwise take an edible and only an edible. 

This tricks your body into having the substance it wants, but in a different form that hits you differently, and also taking away the immediacy that fuels addiction. Which is brain tells me I need this, so I give it this. 

I'm down to basically one 15 mg edible, and an occasional hit of I need it for sleep. I have been able to see all the ways in which this addiction sucks and does not serve me. Every other time I've tried to quit, I resent it and honestly don't really see why I would. This time is very different. And I think I am getting closer to what we all want which is a change in relationship, not a divorce.

It did help me get into a hyper-focus, I will give it that. I quit cold turkey 16 days ago (so proud of myself for staying strong). It would also help me sleep at night, but then I would wake up groggy.

Honestly, I can confidently say that my symptoms are pretty much the same with and without smoking. Again, it would help me get into a deep hyperfocus. However, other things help me get that way too and I‚Äôve been relying on those tools more. High tempo music, a fancy beverage, setting countdown timers to ‚Äúrace‚Äù myself, little high protein snack plates throughout the day with some fancy treat treats (like a little piece of candy or chips).

It‚Äôs really hard, I will admit that. But I also know how much it was destroying my already weak ass dopamine receptors and I wanted to give myself a chance to reset. The hardest part for me was the insomnia because my brain just never shuts the fuck up. I‚Äôve been stopping screen time at 9p and reading or listening to audio books in bed instead, taking magnesium, and drinking bedtime tea. After about 10 days, I‚Äôm finally sleeping again.

Give yourself  a chance. Again, I was defending my use because of my symptoms and it did help some, but after 15 years of chronic use I was realizing that it was affecting my life negatively outside of my adhd symptoms, and I just wasn‚Äôt okay with that anymore.

rsz0uw,inflammation,post,eldertrees_raw_data,"Suffered first full blown panic attack after 15 years of smoking weed daily. Hi all,

I hope you all had a good Christmas.

A few weeks ago I had taken 0.3g of high purity blow, followed by a spliff 4 hours later (when I thought the effects from the blow had died) which turned out to be a a massive mistake, as I was also suffering with a cold at the time. Half an hour after I had the spliff, I started to get heart palpatations, sweats, feelings of being cold/lightheaded, weakness in legs, chest pains, etc.

This lead me to call the paramedics as I thought I was having a heart attack, they took my blood pressure and did an ecg. All tests came back as normal, apart from me having a slightly elevated blood pressure reading.

After that I had been smoking daily as before, with a few minor episodes of feeling anxious. The pain in my chest hadn't subsided, so I went to the hospital (this was 2 weeks after the paramedics had visited me) The hospital did 2 ecgs, full blood tests, an ultrascan, as well as monitoring my vitals for a couple of hours. And again, nothing was detected however, the Dr did say I had an inflamed lung and I was advised to take ibuprofen for the pain. The inflammation should subside on its own, as it was most likely caused by a viral infection (common cold) however, later that night I rolled a very small spliff, probably the smallest I've ever rolled. Big mistake on my part, as I felt some pain in my lungs, and and from that moment onwards I started experiencing heart palpitations, sweats, feeling like I was going to die, etc. This lasted for around an hour, and felt normal after that (I'm glad that I have a high tolerance to weed otherwise, it may have lasted a lot longer)

These are all symptoms of a panic attack, something that I've not experienced in my 15 years of daily smoking. The weed is 90% indica, as high thc sativas tend to make me slightly paranoid/anxious.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through a similar experience? I was thinking about having a t break however, I wanted to to it on my terms however, it looks as though it may be forced upon me.

If anyone else has experienced similar, did this result in you quitting weed altogether or coming back to it at a later date, and if so how did you ease back into it?

Cheers


EDIT: 

Just to add that I had done cocaine 3 weeks ago, not during the last attack I had (2 days ago) and that only involved a small amount of weed by itself. It turns out I have pluracy, and have stopped everything as a result (only using cbd tinctures for the withdrawal)

Yes, I know using cocaine and weed whilst having a cold was extremely stupid and signifies potential psychological issues. Havjng said that, I'm grateful for the responses, and to those who felt the need to respond in a snarky manner, I do hope you don't smoke weed daily else apparently the hypocrisy is lost on you ‚úåÔ∏è",1,training_candidate,0
tybt5z,racing heart,post,eldertrees_raw_data,"Racing Heart and Chest Pains When High. Hey, everyone. Kind of a long post. I've been doing a lot of reading trying to get to the bottom of what happened to me and my interaction with weed. I hear that this is pretty common, however, not many people know why. 

I've been smoking for about 2/3 years but not consistently. Like a couple of months at a time. I started with vaping but then moved into using flower. I used to smoke every day. Once in the morning and once at night. Everything would be fine and I used it as a way to keep my anxiety and depression at bay.

After a break in January, however, everything kind of changed. My first joint after the break made my heart rate jump to 165 and I went to ER convinced I was dying. After they found out at the ER that I smoked weed, they brushed it off as a panic attack. 

Afterward, I made an appointment with a cardiologist after I tried smoking again and the same thing happened. My cardiologist did a whole workup done on me that included an echo, checking for blood clots, blood work, and wearing a heart monitor. Everything came out fine.

I took some time before smoking again and I noticed if I took maybe two pulls I'd be okay sometime but even then I would still get a racing heart rate that would go up to 120. I've tried to keep at it in hopes that my tolerance will grow and my heart rate would decrease for a couple of weeks but nothing seems to work. 

Recently, it seemed to get worse this week when I would get a sharp chest pain that would start at the center of my chest and almost feel like it would travel. I'm going to my cardiologist again today to bring up these concerns. 

As I've said in the beginning, I've seen some old posts about people experiencing those before and not having a conclusion. Has anyone here experienced this or know someone who has? Can it truly be anxiety or could cannabis affect the heart?

u12n90,can't fall asleep,post,eldertrees_raw_data,"Severe Panic Attacks from Bud Suddenly I noticed quite a few people here are expressing the same thing, maybe it's happening more or I just never noticed.

I smoked every day for 7 years all day. It's a big part of who I am, just what I've always done since I was a teenager.

However about 4 months ago I had a panic attack, usual stuff, heart, thought I was going to die etc. It happened a few more times after I kept trying to smoke. Usually it was every other high.

The problem with my heart anxiety has carried over to sober me as well since the first time it happened. I often go a day without sleeping because I can't fall asleep. In the car I'll get anxious, I create chest pressure that isn't there and I'm now medicated because of it.

So I've basically quit since then besides the rare hit or tiny tiny hit because I miss it so much.

Basically I just miss smoking, I don't feel the same, I don't enjoy being alone anymore because it always brought me comfort. I'd give anything just to be able to get high at least a couple days a week. I now smoke tiny hits of a 20% thc/ 20% cbd pen and I don't get high or even buzzed really due to fear.

I think I'm getting better though, I sleep more often an it's becoming less extreme when the heart anxiety hits, which is due to my meds (gabapentin) and rewiring my brain VERY SLOWLY.

If you've been through this, I'd kill for advice to just eradicate the problem. It's BS I know it's all in my head and man I just wanna smoke, and sleep good again without having to fall asleep sitting up after hours of being in bed.

Relationship-wise, I have a better relationship with family, and dating has been a lot easier, the pool larger as my mouth, clothes and apartment don't smell purely of the good stuff, and my bank account has improved massively, and I've been able to travel more, concentrate more, remember more. But, I find it impossible to relax now, nothing works, I'm constantly doing something, fidgeting, talking excessively to the point where people get aggitated, eating isn't as enjoyable, I don't play music as much anymore either, something I've been passionate about for so long.

Took one at bedtime and felt anxious, anti social, anti... everything. I was just watching TV, my girl kept trying to be goofy and it was really bugging me. I didn't think much of it because I have anxiety issues and this is pretty normal. Next morning I take a half. Holy shit I've been loosing my mind all day. Never even left the house, the idea of the outside world freaks me tf out. Can't breathe well, my left side of my body's muscles aren't working well (or the right side is too tense, can't tell). Disassociated af! I finally drove to the gas station at 5:30 to get a beer hoping it would relax me & I felt like I was in a simulation. Driving was scary. I can't focus on shit. Anxiety has been so bad all day. Heart rate hasn't been under 100 all day. Highest was 151.. I looked in the mirror and I've got crazy eyes. I look like I'm on heavy stimulants. My entire face is locked up too. It's been 13 hrs now. I'm drinking the beer now   and listening to some relaxing lofi. It's actually making me feel more mellow. I'm worried I'll wake up wigging out though. Idk what happened to me. I've gotten anxiety from weed many times but ive never experienced anything like this. Dosage amount & time is the same as I always use. Has anyone had adverse reactions to delta9? Could it possibly be the brand I used? I don't ever want to experience this again.

Hi! 

I am a 32F and I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice/thoughts/opinions on using marijuana medicinally as opposed to using pharmaceuticals. 

A little backstory, I‚Äôve been on a medication trial since July 2022 and have since been diagnosed with MDD, PMDD, ADHD, anxiety, and likely BPD. Safe to say, it‚Äôs been a really long 2+ years. 

I have been dealing with insomnia for a while now, and have recently discovered that it is likely related to anxiety. I started taking Clonazepam 0.5mg this month (that was prescribed to me last Feb for the drug withdrawal I was experiencing from Duloxetine) as I‚Äôve been desperate for restful sleep. Turns out, it‚Äôs been giving me the easiest/best sleep I‚Äôve had in months. After a week of them, however, I feel like garbage. 

A large part of me is wondering if marijuana may be a better alternative then doing more medication trials. I just don‚Äôt know really anything about marijuana being used medicinally to be able to decide which route I‚Äôd like to take. 

So if anybody has been using cannabis for similar reasons, has gone from a pharmaceutical to cannabis, or really has any opinions about using it for more medicinal purposes I would really love to hear your thoughts!",1,training_candidate,0

UPDATE: Day 9

It‚Äôs 7:50 am just woke up from my sleep, I slept actually really good and got a full 8 hours with there periodic nightmare/vivid dreams but still slept decent besides those. No night sweats last night or trouble really falling asleep (could have been due to a 60 hour work week). 

This morning I feel great, no nausea thus far but still laying in bed, I feel hungry when I usually feel like absolute shit and never have thought about food in the morning. I think now maybe I‚Äôll be able to gain some of my weight back since I‚Äôm 135lbs from 190lbs in 2021. 

I have been farting a lot more and I think that has been a big help with some of the gastrointestinal issues I‚Äôve been having along with my stool coming out easily and not constipated like other days. Hoping for everyone to have a good and positive recovery day.


Hey everyone a bit of background on me, veteran with PTSD, depression, anxiety, insomnia etc all diagnosed and symptoms from time in service.

I started smoking weed (carts) to help with these things at the beginning of 2021, (I would take a hit every 1-2 hours) I can‚Äôt lie weed gave me a relief, it allowed me to breath and actually live my life without being afraid to die every second or some random traumatic event happen to me. That is until it didint and it made me even more sick.

I decided 6 days ago to stop smoking due to inheriting gastrointestinal issues that I thought was cancer or some other disease due to my service, after all the tests I had done (colonoscopy, endoscopy, radiation tests, cat scans, etc) everything came back perfect. I was in denial that it was marijuana because of the relationship I remember with it because I felt like it saved me. However at the end of the day it has slowly been making me worse and not only killing my mental health and turning me into more of a zombie but also my physical health. (I take no other medications and tried to ‚Äúself medicate‚Äù

Last night was hard due to the night sweats and the vivid dreams due to my PTSD but I feel now I need to face my demons, and cannot give into my own brain.

1ex2hca,sweating,post,petioles_raw_data,"A strategy for quitting using RSO After many failed attempts, I finally broke free. Here's the strategy I used. I hope it helps someone else:

It always seemed to me that consuming by inhaling hit my brain a lot harder compared to oral consumption. It also seemed to wear off a lot more quickly which led to additional consumption. So step 1 was to completely eliminate all smoking. I replaced it with 1:1 Rick Simpson Oil (1 part CBD, 1 part THC). 

Days 1-4: 200mgs 2x per day

days 5-8: 150mgs 2x per day

days 9-12: 100mgs 2x per day

days 13-16 switch to Rick Simpson 2:1 (2 parts CBD, 1 part THC) 100mgs 2x per day

days 17-20: combine 50mgs of 2:1 with 100mgs pure CBD (THC free RSO) 2x per day

days 20+: 100mgs THC free RSO as needed. It sort of became easy at this point so I don't remember the details but I eventually eliminated the morning dose and only took before bed time until I just decided to start skipping days and eventually stop altogether.

I think it worked for me for the following reasons:

1. I always gave up previously because the withdrawals were so unpleasant and I don't have the luxury of being able to check out of life for a month. While I still experienced withdrawals (sweating, irritability, weight loss, etc) it was far more manageable than previous attempts.

2. I tried tapering previously but it was hard to accurately dose (especially smoking) and a lot of times I would over-consume (just to be safe) and end up not making any progress. It also seems like standard gummy edibles are inconsistent in dosage whereas RSO being more of a medical grade product is far more consistent.

3. RSO is full-spectrum. I think a lot of the withdrawals are reduced by tapering down using the full plant and reducing the THC slowly. 

4. RSO seems to have a lot of staying power (if that makes sense). With smoking I found myself wanting a hit within a couple hours. RSO lasts much much longer (even longer than standard edibles) and so the cravings were not bad. It takes effect slowly and weens off slowly so you start to become acclimated to feeling sober as well.

5. I think the combined effect of stopping smoking allowed my head to clear slowly. It wasn't such a shock to the system (cold turkey). I got stronger and more motivated as the weeks went on and I saw it working. I was excited to take each new step.

6. I really wanted to quit. I could see it was impacting my life, appearance and relationships. I was praying and asking for a solution.

Lastly, I shared my dosage but it's not necessarily a recommendation. I more-so wanted to share the strategy. You will most likely need to come up with your own starting dose based on your current use.",1,training_candidate,0

Honestly judging my life idk man im scared im beyond paws and into full mental illness zone and im tired of bothering people about my symptoms and how I think i have a mental condition only to be told I dont.

Psychiatrist have told me I dont and so have friends, family and other people who study in psychology.

However im (16m) im tired of everything being blamed on hormones my dad has Schizo-Bipolar and im scared im gonna caught or that I already caught but honestly I feel as if i have.

I often wonder what I really feel like and if everything I feel rn is paws. Ive read so much on reddit and google and learned about every mental illness out there and im convinced i have a great portion of them. üòê

I often wonder if Im depressed; pre paws i was having a good time ig i had sad moments and good ones then i started smoking and yeah. Paws lol! I used to say things like i wish i was dead and all though whenever id get sad or not get my way and I wonder if that was a sign of depression (i was like thirteen or younger when i did this) i remember one time acting like I was going to kill myself cause I couldnt get my way even though I had no intention to ever actually kill myself üòÇ
 My hygiene lacked, i hated and didnt wanna go to school so much other stuff which I was told was normal and that i just needed to work on myself (My hygiene is good now ngl)

Anyway, i just be thinking like i be so insecure about how I look and act sometimes and other times im confident sometimes i feel like my life is shit sometimes i feel the opposite and sometimes i wish my life was like ppl ik and ppl on socials cause they seem to be doing so much better than me LOL.

Anyway, I honestly have done alot of reflecting and I feel like idk im just a lost cause or somethings wrong with me. So many things ive done in the past so many fucked up thoughts these mood swings and a depression that feels so real.

All of these ‚ÄúPaws feelings‚Äù feel real including the thoughts which is why i cant tell the difference and i listen to what ppl say and try to tell myself theyre just thoughts and i try to ignore these feelings and thoughts and do other things but theyre always here.

Some people tell me I need professional help, most people tell me im fine , professionals tell me its just anxiety and I sound fine and like withdrawls just got me

Istg i dont even know anymore and then to make it worse my personality in the last few years was me acting like my idol / favorite rapper cause I thought he was cool so i rlly dont even know the truth about myself rn and no matter how much therapy it feels like nothing is getting better.

I feel like im struggling so much and ill never get better and that this is beyond paws but the world seems to refuse to let me believe that idk. I cant act like i havent had some good times in this mess though infact I just had a good time at universal studios with my family and on vacation alot but the feeling comes back randomly during those times. Windows and Waves are such a weird concept cause I never really get 100% windows or its usually just a mixed in meaning sometimes during the day i feel good sometimes bad yk and each day is just different my symptoms are so random and all over the place that I cant even list all of them cause id forget some, miss some or only think about specific ones i just dont know anymore.

This is my life im only 16 years old and I feel so self aware of my past and everything thats going on with me. I feel like i have all these mental illnesses and I probably do and I‚Äôll probably be suffering with chronic mental health issues for LIFE. Ontop of hormones, sexual thoughts, me looking place cause of list , weird ideas and temptations etc. I just dont know anymore


I feel so lost in life as if I dont rlly know where i stand or who I am or whats going on with me I only know whats happen and what google and reddit says and what other people have said and how it feels in the moment.

Idk anymore im going crazy, im spiraling and i just am ready for this to be over I can say I wanna end it all and have no intention of killing myself i just want peace honestly this isn‚Äôt peace its far from it

Im 9 months and nothings got better for me maybe that THCP synthethic shit is rlly strong and probably has the same effects as meds on my brain

This is my last vent though im just gonna continue to suffer in silence until it gets too much to bare again. Like i said im tired of annoying people with my thoughts, feeling like a burden, feeling like im crazy, all of this other shit im just tired of it all so ill keep going on with my life and try to make the best of it ik ill have good days but know these feelings will always be here and around the corner

I cant tell/know the difference between emotions no more in my mind. Anger and Happiness are manic,sadness is depression, guilt and shame are BPD or Impostor syndrome, Lust and Arousal are Hypersexuality, fear is anxiety.

Idk how to break this way of thinking and i start my next go around of therapy in October to track my paws progress so hopefully things get better.

I‚Äôve always been surrounded by people who experience panic attacks, and as someone with anxiety, one of my biggest fears in life was to experience chronic panic attacks. Last night, while I was high, I decided to smoke one last time before going to sleep. As soon as I got into bed, I started feeling my heartbeat and began tossing and turning because I couldn‚Äôt sleep. All of a sudden, I started thinking, 'What if I always get trapped in these negative thoughts at night and end up with insomnia?' Right after that thought, things started to spiral out of control. A tremendous amount of stress and a rising panic started to form whenever I thought of something bad. Normally, I would joke around with my own mind when Im sober, like, 'Look, the thing you‚Äôre afraid of is happening, but you‚Äôre totally fine.' But this time, as soon as I thought of the 'feared scenario,' the situation worsened. Whatever bad thought I had, it felt like it was going to come true, and my body responded with sweating, shaking, and an elevated pulse. I immediately got up, washed my hands and face, and flushed all the weed down the toilet. I couldn‚Äôt sleep the entire night, and the thought that I would have to go to work in the morning without any sleep was driving me crazy. Especially the thought of ‚Äòwhat if this becomes permanent‚Äô completely shut down my thought process. I kept scolding myself, thinking, 'What have you done to yourself? . This was a sign for me.

1f2hvbr,dream,post,marijuana_raw_data,"My scary journey with Marijuana and why I am done with it. First time posting here, but I really need to get this off my chest. I'm not sure if this will get any traction of exactly what I'm asking for, but my experiences with weed have been absolutely terrible, and I would just like to share. Maybe others have had the same experiences and will get something out of this.

I've only smoked weed about 10 times in my life (I'm 33, first time at 21), and 5 of those times, I have passed out or almost passed out. The other 5 times, I have felt absolutely zero effects from ingesting in all forms. This last time, last weekend will be the last time I ever smoked weed. 

The first time I smoked, I was 21 and was at a bar when someone offered me a joint. I had no clue how to smoke it, didn't know how to inhale it, and didn't feel anything from it. I drove home from the bar with too much alcohol in my system and was pulled over and arrested for DUI. The officer said he smelled marijuana on me and checked, but nothing. Needless to say, it was not a good first experience with weed.

I didn't smoke again until 25 when friends offered me a bong hit. Again, I didn't know how to do it (still don't, so forgive my ignorance), blew into the pipe instead, got water everywhere, and ruined the weed in it. Again, not a fun experience.

A couple of my other experiences, ages 26-38, I was given weed chocolate covered pretzels at a bar from a bartender (no effects), a 10 or 20 mg edible that I bought at a dispensary (no effects), and a couple of joints and edibles from dispensaries with friends that did absolutely nothing for me. 

It's confusing to me why I can't feel ""high"" from marijuana. I don't understand it. I talk to my friends who all smoke so that I know what to expect, but nothing ever happens. I don't feel anything. I kept doing it, hoping something would change and I would feel it, but nothing.

This is when things get dark and scary. 2 years ago when I was 31, I was on a rafting trip with friends when we all smoked many joints. I shared only one, and about an hour after ingesting it on the drive home, I passed out in the passenger seat of the car. I was only out for about 5 seconds, but the lead-up was scary. My vision started going black until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. 

I go to many concerts, and about 6 months after that incident, I was in California for a show. I went to a local dispensary and bought a weed vape pen to take to the show. I was sitting on the lawn enjoying it and barely hitting the pen, but after about 30 minutes, I felt the same sensation of being about to pass out. This was scary because I was by myself, with no one to help me if I did. I fought the best I could and didn't pass out, but the sensation was terrifying. I do remember thinking at the time, ""Is this what being high feels like, having to fight the feeling of passing out? Is this what everybody is so excited about?"" I know this is not the case, but I thought it nonetheless.

The next time, I was also at a concert in my home state of Colorado. I was at a bluegrass show, where many people were smoking, and my friends shared a joint. I had thought the previous time might possibly be because of weed, but there were other contributing factors (no other drugs but lack of sleep, high stress, etc). I thought maybe if I did it in a small amount, had enough sleep, and felt comfortable, I would maybe be able to feel high for the first time. I felt the sensation that I was going to pass out again, and this time, I passed out for a while. My friend told me I was sweating profusely, my eyes went purple, and I was out for about 15 seconds. My other friend immediately went and got medical. This caused a huge scene, caused my friends to have a bad time, and affected everybody around me. Everybody was watching me; I felt like a complete idiot. And just because of weed.

Okay, that was it for me. I need to see a doctor and figure out what the fuck is wrong with me. I googled it as well, and so did my friends. We decided it was probably because the weed was lowering my blood pressure too much. I already have low blood pressure, and the weed was dropping it to dangerous levels. I went to my doctor and told him all about this one and my previous use. He basically confirmed that it is probably lowering my blood pressure too much but didn't really offer any other explanations or reasons. It felt like he just agreed with me when I tried to offer my explanation.

The fourth time was when I was by myself, laying in bed comfortable, ""experimenting"". I wanted to see if I was literally as comfortable as possible in my own environment, enjoying everything, smoking just a little. Would it still happen? It did. This one was very light, but I felt so stupid. I didn't have anyone around me to help if it happened. I told myself that was the last time. I believed it. Why the fuck am I putting myself in these dangerous situations knowing what is going to happen, thinking that it won't. All to chase this ""high"" that everyone else talks about. 

Fast forward to this past weekend. About 1.5 years have passed since I last tried weed. I'm at a concert with a friend. I am drinking lightly, but no other drugs. He is a heavy smoker, and he and everyone around me are smoking weed. I start to think about trying it again. If I literally just take one puff, that can't be too bad, right? I ask him for a hit. He knows about my previous experiences and asks me if I'm sure. I say, ""Only one, that's it."" After only about 3-5 minutes, I feel it coming. I told my friend that we needed to go and that I needed to sit down. He tells my other friend to go get medical. I passed out, and let me tell you, this one was fucking scary. He told me, I was completely purple, it looked like I stopped breathing, I was drenched in sweat, I even pissed myself. I was out for a long time, according to them. While I was passed out, it felt like I was fighting for my life. I distinctly remember thinking that my heart stopped 3 or 4 times and putting all my strength and effort into ""coming back"" from that. I had dreams that I was being given CPR, and they had paddles on my chest to restart my heart, though that never happened. It was fucking scary. I literally felt like I had died and came back. I talked to medical after for a while. They said the normal stuff. ""You were just dehydrated; what other substances have you had? Weed doesn't do that."" I know for a fact I wasn't dehydrated, I had been drinking water all day, and had liquid iv (hydration aid), in my water bottle that I carry around at all times. I had no other substances in my system other than drinking lightly. 

I didn't get any answers there. But I do know that I am done. Absolutely, for sure; there is no way in hell that I am trying to smoke weed again. After this past time, I feel like if I try it again, I will actually die this time. I never thought weed to be dangerous or scary; all of my friends do it. But now I know that it isn't for me. 

Sorry for the long story, but thanks for reading if you did. I feel like this was necessary to get my thoughts and experiences down as it will help me reconcile my thoughts and clarify that I do not need weed anymore. If it helps just one person, that will be worth it. I have an appointment with another doctor this week to discuss this more. Maybe I will get answers, maybe I won't. If any of you have any advice or medical thoughts, or anything, please let me know. I am open and all ears. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!

1f3uym0,sweating,post,petioles_raw_data,"First 3 days are the worst  Im taking my first proper break in a couple of years and just needed to talk it through with someone who understands. 

I used to be a very very heavy user. Talking 10-12 joints per day, plus random bong hits in between. About 3 years ago I took a 3 week break and purchased a dry herb vape. That massively reduced my usage until I fell into a routine of about 3-4 sessions per night on a weekday and unlimited use on weekends. 

I've taken this current break because I think I enjoy the dry herb vape so much it's literally all I think about. When I'm at work I'm constantly pushing away thoughts of getting home and hitting the vape. When I'm out doing things I should be enjoying all im thinking about is the vape. So I ran out of bud on Sunday and didn't buy more. 

Day 1-2 were just craving central. Occasionally raiding the room for any lost bits of weed (never found any), buy holy shit day three was rough. Sweating, sickness, aches and pains, migraines. I also came to the conclusion that weed helps a lot of my sensory issues caused by autism. A few days no weed and every smell bothered me, the textures of foods (something I've always struggled with) made me sick. The smell sensitivity was so bad I threw up on Tuesday night due to the smell of food I'd cooked 3 hours previous. This made matters worse as I also threw up my mental health medication. 

So on day three I was withdrawing from weed and my meds. I was plagued by weird thoughts and overtly religious images every time I closed my eyes.

1f52fxy,anxiety,post,cbd_raw_data,"Is it safe to take CBD gummies as a recovering THC addict? My goal in 2024 was to give up THC entirely after being a chronic weed smoker for over 13+ years. The first month was very hard, but around the end of month two, it got remarkably easier and my cravings began to evaporate completely. 

Last month, 6.5 months into my THC quitting journey, I was dealing with really bad insomnia due to covid, and in a desperate attempt to finally get a good nights sleep, I took a CBD gummy that my dad offered me.

Despite my past THC addiction, I never bothered ever consuming CBD since I didn't see the point of taking cannabis without getting high. My understanding was that these products did not have any THC in them whatsoever, so when I took the gummy last month, I assumed that would be okay for me to do and wouldn't interfere with my weed sobriety.

The CBD gummy worked really well in combination with melatonin, so much so that I bought more and started taking them before bed more often (0-3 times a week) since outside of covid, I have chronic insomnia that happens when I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

  
Last night, however, I took a CBD gummy around 3 AM since I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep, and after taking it, I fell asleep and had a very vivid and anxiety inducing dream that I had gotten high and subsequently remembered that I don't smoke weed anymore! I felt really high in the dream, likely due to the physical effects of the CBD, so it really freaked me out. Then, when I woke up, I was re-reading the label on the packaging of the CBD gummy only to learn the product contains less than .3% THC!! Now I am terrified that there is THC in my system again and potentially interfering with my brain's ability to detox from THC.

I know that non-alcoholic beers also contain a small amount of alcohol, and alcoholics are fine to drink them without a risk of relapse, so my hope is that the same fundamentals apply to CBD. That being said, I would love to hear more from you all. Are CBD gummies safe for recovering THC addicts to take? Did I just erase all of my progress? I haven't really had any cravings for weed since I first started taking CBD last month, but regardless, I'm a bit stressed out about the whole situation.",1,training_candidate,1

1fdeeq0,can't move,post,petioles_raw_data,"EXTREME FATIGUE, but only hitting later in the day/afternoon?? Anyone? (I'm enjoying reading all the fatigue threads, good motivation, but I didn't see this specifically...)

It's taken me a few weeks to put together what's been happening (after letting weed creep back in as a ""sleep aid""). I avoided carts this time, which gave me devil withdrawals, but here's what happens:

* In the morning I feel pretty great. Having coffee and monster and getting work done and the brain firing reasonably well.
* Sometimes it's after lunch, sometimes 5p, but definitely by 7p -- HOLY GOD I CAN'T MOVE. The sheer force of will it would take to take the dog out for a walk is massive. Just total physical couch lock laziness. The brain would be fine with some TV maybe (or weed!), but even video games would seem like effort.

As an experiment I tried some weed when the fatigue hit. And it WENT AWAY?!? I could go for a walk and listen to music and be up for awhile. This made me think maybe it's just a daily withdrawal. The fatigue has that strong boredom flavor to it, like the body wants to lead you to the weed.

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone has had anything similar? Not fatigue and brain fog on waking, but something hitting later in the day like a caffeine addict who has gone too long without coffee?

1feo5s9,agony,post,petioles_raw_data,"Six Months since my last dance with THC I've been a reader of this sub for several years as I repeatedly tried and failed to get control of my cannabis usage. After over a decade of daily use, I burned out and made the progress that I've been wanting to make for a long time. I wanted to write this as encouragement for anyone that is hoping to make a change, or struggling through the first week of withdrawals. 

As I mentioned, I was a daily user for a long time - to the point where it was just a part of who I was. The cravings were stronger than my willpower, and I learned to live with the paranoia and worry that people would know I was high (they absolutely knew). With easy access to Delta 8, and other isomers, it got that much easier for me to get high whenever I felt the tingle of boredom or anxiety. 

Finally, I decided to do the hard work, and fight through the withdrawal period and see what happened. I won't sugar-coat it; it was damn hard. There were days in the first week where I spent a lot of time just laying on the floor - waiting for the day to end so I could go to bed and have some weird-ass dreams. 

After awhile, I got to where I could think past the craving, and actually imagine what the process of smoking/vaping would look like for me. I was able to visualize the initial feeling of satisfaction, followed by the guilt, shame and paranoia that would surely follow. I still do that today, as the cravings haven't completely disappeared. It's much easier to redirect my thoughts now, though. 

In this midst of all of this, I started going to therapy, and actually did a ketamine therapy program, which was expensive, but helpful in changing my habits. I'm lucky that I had a great support system behind me, and people helping me to keep looking forward. 

If you find yourself struggling to get through that first day or first week, just know that it's worth it, and that the agony of the cravings and withdrawal will pass, and you'll get a little stronger each time you stand your ground. If I could do it, you can do it. I'm rooting for you.",1,training_candidate,0

i3soprz,racing heart,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"I have been vaping flower for a couple of years now and I, too, occasionally get the racing heart, some chest pain, etc. It feels similar to a panic attack to me, but it's completely physiological - the cannabis otherwise relaxes me in ways nothing else seems to these days. 

Cannabis is known to raise blood pressure and can cause these physiological effects in some people. You're likely not having a ""traditional"" panic attack, but your body is having a physiological response to the cannabinoids. 

If you have high blood pressure, make sure you stay on top of your medication and maybe talk to your doctor about how to find ways to minimize the effects if you wish to continue smoking. If all is well,though, you may just need to remind yourself when you feel that raciness that it's just the weed and it will pass. 

And, even though everyone is now saying the difference between sativas and indicas is bullshit (the argument is there are few true single strains out there anymore with all the hybridization) I do find the strain matters. These days I have White Widow I grew that I use only in the daytime because I and everyone I have shared it with has commented on how racy it makes us feel. For night time use, I have some stuff my neighbor grew - I think it's Gushers or Zkittles - that does not have any of that raciness and actually helps me sleep. So, the bottom line here is that you may need to experiment, and you're best doing that with the stuff you have access to, whether you grow it yourself or go to a dispensary. I find the strain reports on Leafly and such somewhat helpful, but strains are frequently mislabeled or have different effects on different people.

Sometimes though I do just want to drown all my emotions out and dose higher than I usually would, I think that's when things start slipping a bit for me in terms of productivity, being emotionally available for my family and just being mentally healthy(er) overall. I don't intend to take a t break because I have tried that 3 times this year, the longest being 3 weeks and I was just miserable and at its worst, suicidal.

I do realise I am dependent on cannabis at the moment and I am ok with that. Though I also do wish to use less in the future, at the moment I just don't have the energy or capacity to really work on the root causes of my anxiety and depression so having a break just doesn't seem like an option at the moment.

I am also aware however that chronic and long term use has its downsides for some, of which I may be one, but in some ways this is unprecedented territory for me, so I tend to interrogate my motives and usage often. I've already lost a friend to acute schizophrenia a decade ago and it weighs heavily on me at times when I am on a low.

jd0y8vv,overwhelmed,comment,mmj_raw_data,"Lots of good advice here so far! 

Your journey with cannabis will likely involve a lot of trial and error, and that is perfectly okay. 

Smoking and vaping will be your quickest methods of feeling effects. I agree with those that say take 1 single inhale of a joint, bowl, or vape. You dont need to hold it in forever, just a second or two in your lungs. See how you feel in about 20 minutes. If you're able to, put on some music or a show you enjoy, as this will help you relax and enjoy it. Deep breathing is the best tool if you ever feel overwhelmed and need to ground yourself. 

Edibles feel similar, but it can take longer to find a sufficient dose and the onset takes longer as well, and will last significantly longer than inhalation methods (smoking or vaping). It is still very worth exploring.

There's a lot to learn! Things to look into are sativa (daytime or active strains) and indica (night time or chill time strains), the endocannabinoid system, the entourage effect (this is that THC and CBD are most effective when combined). 

I would look into finding low THC strains/cultivars (under 15% to start), as you can always go higher. Vapes are going to be much stronger as they contain cannabis concentrate. This will still have the smell, but much less (btw that smell is from terpenes, which contain the chemical compounds that give cannabis its taste and odour. You may eventually find a terpene in a flower cultivar that you actually like the smell of. If not, that's okay too)

CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, meaning it does not get you high like THC. You can find strains and products that are just CBD, or a combination of CBD and THC. CBD is useful for pain, inflammation, sleep, and anxiety, among other things. It doesn't really feel like much, and is very safe in high doses. I'm still learning about CBG and CBN myself, but I hear they are also great for things like sleep.

Leafly.com is a great resource. I like using it to look up strains and their effects. Best of luck!",1,training_candidate,0

I started out a year ago taking 25mg D8 once a day. Then increased to 40mg a few months later, then 60mg a few months later. Then I started doing 60mg twice a day, then 3 times a day up to 150mg a day.

It was mostly a fun experience, only had a few times where I felt paranoid or anxious. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I started feeling weird a few hours after taking it. Fast heartrate, nausea, feelings of sadness for no reason. I think it was my body‚Äòs way of telling me to slow down, or I was starting to get CHS, I don‚Äôt know.  

I stopped cold turkey and thought I would be fine. For the first few days I had terrible anxiety, upset stomach. Almost threw up a few times but didn‚Äôt. Could barely eat.

k6w5i6v,spiraling,comment,mmj_raw_data,"So yes you are correct in that CBD has the potential to trigger or worsen CHS, however the community is split as some people have found success with using it alone while others have found CBD to be worse for their CHS than THC.

The thought of stopping forever is absolutely scary especially if you, like me, have found so much relief in other aspects of your body/life with cannabis. Worry not, though, as if you can reset your receptors and consume the lower THC % flower on special occasions in a smaller dose you will absolutely be able to enjoy cannabis again without feeling the CHS.

I will tell you that after I finish a 90 day reset, even one hit of 15% THC flower can send you spiraling as it did with me. What I will usually do is start with a CBD only flower my first time smoking. This is because mentally I am already extremely nervous to try cannabis again after so long (worried ill trigger CHS) that sometimes the anxiety alone is enough to make me feel sick the first time smoking.

Im prescribed cannabis to manage migraine disorder and myofascial pain in pretty much every muscle in upper back and neck, tremors and general muscle spasms. I discovered much to my happiness that it also did a great deal to calm racing thoughts and uplift mood.

I can't tell you exactly how any grams/dose or day. I can only estimate. AM and if needed mid afternoon dose = 1 slightly less than full chamber of cannabis Sativa or Hybrid flower cut 1:1 with either Pink Panther CBD flower or Wild Cherry CBG flower. (Hard to find strains with other cannabanoids in my state.) 

To vape all flower I need to run three ""sessions"" on low temp (love tasting the terpenes). Generally right after a tolerance break I only do one session/dose so really, it's a pretty low dose! At bedtime I'll vape all three sessions with the last one on higher temp to make sure there is zero green left and all the ABV is nice golden color. 

For reference, a Davinci IQ2 chamber is just slightly larger than the Mighty+ chamber but the way I load it it is darn close to same amount I actually use. 

At night/bedtime my objective is to feel very relaxed and a bit sedated so I consume flower with such effects both regular and CBD or CBN. Pink Panther CBD is a very calming flower and it's my fav for blending at night.

lc1gdmy,migraine,comment,trees_raw_data,"Ngl, this post stemmed from me being super duper annoyed about people spreading misinformation without sources so I feel ya. The folks at my dispensary have vented to me about that too, about how much bad knowledge they have to unwind. We were talking about people from other states and how long it takes to adjust their strain dose because they really have no idea what they're talking about, which isn't their fault. I took all that and did some community service, lol.

My personal commentary supports the neurological effects of terps. I could easily see some of the other effects being over exaggerated or only acheiveable in unrealistic doses as people as repeatedly mentioned. That said, the neurological effects of limonene seems to be pretty consistent from my understanding. I've come off 2 migraine injections, 2 neurological medications, and am half way weaned off the last one. I spent $22k on medical and neurological treatments before I came to this medical state and I had access to weed then. I smoked all day every day sitting there sober before because that type of weed just wasn't doing anything for me. The first day I went to my dispensary, they gave me a low thc hybrid that was high limonene and it changed my life.  One hit of the right strain and it was instant relief. I get all of the positive effects, don't get too sleep or unable to function levels of high. It's amazing what proper medical cannabis can do. I fucking love this drug.",1,training_candidate,1
ldcjl7u,sleep,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"No. There is no general rule of thumb to how someone with ADHD would respond here. In addition, everyone responds to cannabis differently outside of medical conditions. 

Here are how the two typically behave: 

Indica strains help people relax and feel calm. They are good for pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Many use Indica at night because it makes them sleepy. But this can be a problem during the day when you need to stay awake and active.

Sativa strains are more energizing. They boost creativity and focus, making them great for daytime use. Sativa can lift your mood and help with depression. **However, it can sometimes cause anxiety or paranoia, especially in high amounts.**",1,training_candidate,0

The tricky part is that a lot of the good shit in full-spectrum weed also makes it smell pretty strong.",1,training_candidate,0
lfd82vu,anxious,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"Different strains of cannabis can produce vastly different effects. I recommend getting some lightly dosed edibles, so it last most of the day without having to smoke throughout the day, as well as more balanced relief. The strains seem to matter a bit less in edibles for a specific effect. Start small and don‚Äôt drive or anything stupid. 

If you‚Äôre not opposed to smoking or vaping then I would recommend getting one indica and one sativa strain of bud to see what helps you more. For me, sativas calm me, for others it can make them more anxious. Also, CBD makes me feel awful and cranky. So it‚Äôs about how your individual body responds to it. Whichever one works the best, you then try different versions of it. Like it‚Äôs indica, but there are hundreds of different ones. So try a few and then see what‚Äôs working and go from there. 

If you enjoy gardening, growing your own always makes the best medicine and builds a healthy relationship with it the plant(it‚Äôs fun to grow things imo). Then you can really get into selecting a specific plant after a while that treats it for you. I took three years developing a strain specifically for my PTSD and social anxiety, and every time I smoke it I get 3 to 4 hours of peace. I can actually have conversations with people where it‚Äôs not just me trying to end it and leave from the beginning.

One thing you may want to research is Paul stamets, and listen to a few of his talks or lectures.

lgq1858,agony,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"I had some issues with repeatedly vomiting that's dismissed because I smoke weed when I go to the ER or certain doctors. But I started vomiting regularly before I smoked weed, and it did not get better at all when I stopped using weed. Your vomiting tracks exactly with your weed usage. You didn't use weed for very long and CHS is usually associated with long term weed use, but not always.

The best way to find out whether it's CHS or something else is to eliminate marijuana and see if you stop vomiting. That's the research-supported medical process for ruling out CHS. I'd strongly suggest quitting all weed for 30 days. If you see improvements, stay quiet, at least for a few months. You could try again and see if the vomiting comes back but you already have a trend. If you don't see improvements, well, it's not the weed. But you have to give it several weeks at least!! A couple days won't work.

Also consider how intense the vomiting is. If you are vomiting violently, like can't stop, you are in nauseous painful agony and need to keep wretching or might die, violent, CHS is more likely. If you find relief in a hot shower or bath, CHS is more likely. If you can't go a few weeks without vomiting while smoking rather than sometimes going a month or two, CHS is more likely.

I know every doctor out there thinks vomiting+weed=CHS like it's really common, hence this post. It's not super common! But it does happen. You may have CHS... You do have a solid correlation even with only three data points. You also may not! If so, yay! You get to keep smoking weed! But the *only* way you will convince any doctor that it's not the weed is to quit again for at least a month to prove you don't have any improvements. The docs will want a solid data point to show there is NOT a correlation.",1,training_candidate,0
lhv7gjw,dream,comment,petioles_raw_data,"I've recently tried to do it. I went from smoking 4-5 grams of live resin for years to nothing. I just felt like dabs have kind of wrecked my life in ways as embarassing as it is to say. I used to be really opposed to them but got into them around the pandemic as my main way of blazing. Just gets you from point a to point b so much quicker. Taste better etc. I found it was spiking my anxiety and depression like crazy tho. Making me someone I didn't want to be. Ruined my tolerance as well. I'm on week two of no dabs. My friend came over last weekend had two joints with him and a bowl or two the next day but that's pretty well been it for past week and a bit. I've pretty will blazed daily since I was 15 or so. So 15 years. Longest break I've ever taken is 1-2 weeks.

 Feeling a bit proud of myself but I know I have a long road ahead of me. I do want to try my best to keep weed to a few times a month or less. I'm pretty much swearing off dabs for life tho. They're too addictive to me and I don't want to get into that cycle again. Only thing that sucks now is I have a Puffco pro, Puffco og, and an e-nail. Don't know where to get rid of them.

liql8lp,soreness,comment,leaves_raw_data,"Just passed a month, the longest I've gone without it since I had an injury a few years ago, and getting close to the longest I've gone in the 17 years I've smoked.

I've tried tapering down. It never works. At some point you'll just buy more and keep putting it off, or something bad will happen (as things do in life) that'll get you to say ""OK, well this happened and I need to sleep, soo...""

This time I'm done. My mentality needed to change. I'm not treating it as something so extremely hard, yet keeping the quitting part very serious. I still have weed here, pens I can attach to my vape, leaves I can pack into a bowl, and bowls and bongs I can use. Still here, right where I left them.

The difference is I tell myself now ""this is my alcoholism, and that is my beer."" Sure, alcoholism is way more dangerous and harder to get over, but not for me, and it helped put things in perspective. I can't have a little. I can't taper off. I can't just smoke socially like everyone else around me. I can't say ""well, maybe EVENTUALLY I can do it socially..."" That's giving the addiction power over you. This is my alcoholism, and that it my beer.

What got me to put it down was realizing that despite the hold it has over me, despite the mental push I have to smoke, despite all the power I've given it... at the end of the day, quitting is literally as simple as just *not smoking it*. Not putting the weed in the bowl, not lighting it, not inhaling. It's as simple as just... not doing it and carrying on. 

It's all about the power you give the *addiction* itself. 

Things I've noticed since quitting:

1- For the first time in my life I have ambitions. I'm no longer okay with just working enough to be able to pay bills and eat. I'm maybe a few weeks away from being ready to start my own small LLC and have been researching the process and insurances I would need, on top of business cards and a uniform, and talks with places that would hand out my cards and help get me clients. This would've never started with stoner me, and now I'm just waiting for the funds to pull the trigger on it. My mind is on that more than the sweet game I just downloaded or a movie I'm excited about.


2- The things I love I still love, but in different and more powerful ways. I love videogames, always have, and I was afraid I wouldn't like them as much sober. I can't really get myself to play the more mindless ones nowadays, but I've traded that for diving into a story and characters more. I ask questions in BG3, I'm reading notes in Guild Wars 2, and I just re-downloaded red dead 2 to see how much more I can get from what is imo the greatest story a game has ever told. Last night I watched The Godfather pt2, a movie I'd seen hundreds of times, and I swear there were so many things I just never cared to pick up on before bc I was always blasted watching it, so much so that I realized i like that movie way more than pt1 now.


3- I'm starting to cook for myself. I was always okay with just making sandwiches. For years and years that all I did. Various forms of sandwiches or fast food. Last week I was craving a burger. As I was about to leave to go to Culver's, as I always do when I want a burger, I stopped myself and said ""you know what? Let's make a burger. I can still use the onions, tomatoes, lettuce for other things, I need mayo anyways... let's go make one,"" and I fucking did. It was spicy, it was juicy, and my heart wasn't leaping out of my chest from all the butter and bad shit. 


4- I can focus and handle anxiety, pick up on social queues, and rethink things better than I ever could before. When I thought I needed weed to slow my mind down, I realized I was just becoming zombified in a fog. I sat on a bench the other day, smoked a cig, and wondered about the light reflecting from the river, what that butterfly's tiny mind was thinking as it fluttered past me, how the wind blowing past can feel so good on my skin, and what that feeling might actually be. Thoughts my stoned mind would've NEVER had. Before I would've sat there like a lump of fat cooking in the sun with a goofy smile on my face. Now that smile was at the world, not at the fog.


5- That injury I had affected a bunch of parts on the left side of my body, and my circulation. When I'd get stressed, my heart would beat like crazy, the left side of my neck would tighten, sometimes the side of my stomach where the injury was would sting or hurt a little. It's a lot better than it was, but the healing has been so slow. I swear I feel like my healing has gone through the roof since quitting. My heart doesn't pump like crazy, I'm handling the stress better, my neck doesn't get tight, etc. I can't quite explain how, but I feel like my body has been settling back into what it was before. I went for a run yesterday, something that would get my injury to flair up everytime I'd do it before, and today I just feel... kinda sore all over. It's not centered on the injured parts, it's not stabbing pains, it's just normal soreness from working out.


6- The most important one, and the most simple. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have control over myself. My mind and body are one. I'm not just thinking maybe I'm strong enough, I KNOW it, and knowing it is a power I never had before. I'm not letting things happen and just smoking my problems away, I'm MAKING things happen. It's a power you're trading for addiction, and it can only come from the trade and nothing else. It comes from you and from you alone. That child I used to be, the child that we all have in us, I know now that he's smiling. I feel his tiny smile in my soul, his little hands pumping the air and rooting for me. I'm not doing this to get laid, I'm not doing this for my mom or my dad, I'm not even doing this for me. I'm doing this for that little boy who had so many more hopes for me. I'm doing this because HE deserves better from me, even when I feel like I don't deserve it. He does, and so does that child in you.

I'm sorry this is so long. I get carried away when I write things, and this was probably more for me than it is for you. I'm gonna save this so I can look at my own words later if I feel like falling off the wagon. If you do read this, all of this, every word, then I think you know that you need this too. You can get there. You can absolutely get there, just like I'm getting there, because at the end of the day...

lj6nwds,tossing and turning,comment,leaves_raw_data,"I quit for 3 months. Ended up smoking again and that feeling of anxiety and panic when I first smoked again was so incredibly intense.

I‚Äôm lucky enough where I can choose to work or not so the first few days of not smoking I didn‚Äôt work everyday so the no sleep didn‚Äôt effect me as much. It was hard to fall asleep at night for the first two weeks. Atleast two hours of tossing and turning. For some reason I would always crash at around noon and could damn near fall asleep standing up.

lja6u4r,dread,comment,leaves_raw_data,"I much prefer weaning myself when I stop using weed. If I'm vaping 2g a day and I suddenly stop, I'll have a week or pretty intense withdrawal symptoms like insomnia, lack of appetite, intense mood swings, things like that. I'll also DREAD the thought of stopping, I'll feel the hooks of the plant firmly in my brain.

But I find if I taper down over two weeks to vaping 0.1g a day for a couple days at the end, I'll be able to stop vaping without caring about it much at all. And the physical symptoms will last for more like a day rather than two weeks or longer.

But that's easier said than done. Other times I've lacked the self control to taper down, and ended up just finishing at a huge daily dose and suffering the consequences.

Then, there was a doctor who said RSO (especially) or any edible with THC and small amounts of CBD would help, after surgery, because it would act as a painkiller and not make you cough & strain you incisions.

I know the feeling of trying to knit or cook while sobbing and wishing I could just take a hit, it‚Äôs not an easy task but with practice it honestly does get easier.

ye9uv1,agony,post,mmj_raw_data,"smallest batch diy concentrates? Does anyone have experience making SMALL batch concentrates. I'm in a situation lol. 

I just had a wisdom tooth extracted. It was an emergency/abscess scenario so I didn't really think about my MMJ situation beforehand. I am a daily user and trying to cut back on smoke, but unfortunately all I have on hand now is herb and vape. :/ Don't wanna risk dry socket obviously. 

I don't tend to agree w edibles (the main reason I use is for nausea/appetite, without weed I eat < 500 cals a day). But I can use them if they're melt-able (chocolate/ gummies/ RSO) since then I can do sublingual.

When I googled about this all I could find was rec users being like ""just take a T break it's more fun anyway üôÑ you can go 1 week without getting high üôÑ"" and I am so annoyed by that... _I don't smoke to get high!!!_ That must be effing nice!!!! üôÑüôÑ Plus If you ever talk about taking a T break or going cold turkey off any other daily meds you take your doctor would scream. But with weed it's just expected!! 

Anyway. I'd like to make a small batch of concentrate / tincture / butter if possible, just for the week, something that can be taken sublingually. i don't usually make my own, and recipes always call for bulk herb-- which I understand! it's a concentrate, you need a lot to make a little. But I only have access to a smaller amount rn and I'm just trying to figure out if I can make that work somehow without smoking it. 

I'm guessing I'm gonna be SOL here and wind up taking a chocolate. Or I'll just leave it and take the Norco they gave me ... but I thought maybe this sub would be more understanding than the general weed subs, cus... It's NOT that ""I can't go 1 day without it."" It's that I use it to treat multiple chornic and painful conditions, I can't SLEEP without it, and those issues don't just conveniently go away so I can recover from surgery in peace, ykw I mean? Like I think it's probably better for my healing if I can actually sleep a bit and not be in agony all day just saying lol my body _needs rest_ right now, I am WIRED. If I HAVE to go several days without mmj I will but I just truly do think it'll help if I can figure out a _safe_ way to ingest. 

Anyway ‚úåÔ∏è peace and love and thanks in advance for any tricks u might have! 

I will likely end up pinching some edibles from family instead of smoking, don't worry about me risking dry socket, I Will Not.

1ds3ji7,can't move,post,marijuana_raw_data,Beginner questions and advice Hi all. First of all thank you in advance for any advice I can get. Gonna try to make this as short as I can. I'm looking to get into smoking. I'm looking for something that will make me relax after a stressful day. I work with special needs adults and it can be a very stressful job. I want to come home and take a hit to relax but still function. I have 2 young children so I still have alot to do when home. People have told me to just take a small hit. I have a pen and edibles but everything gets me so fucked up I end up sitting on the couch for hours and can't move. Is there a specific strain that is better for what I'm looking for? I honestly don't know anything about this stuff and don't really have any reliable source to go to. Any advice would be awesome. Have a great day!,1,training_candidate,0

ipthrg0,racing heart,comment,mmj_raw_data,"I have had to have this conversation a few times and it is weird everytime. Depending on where you are you are fighting through a lot of 'devils lettuce'/drugs are bad programming.

I start with talking about CBD and the great results people have had with it. If you have a real CBD store or dispensary I'd recommend that route.  CBD gummies are treated as vitamins and really have no oversight on if there is any CBD actually in it. 

Say over and over with CBD there are no psychoactive effects.

If that part of the conversation is going well (or maybe start here depending on your aunt), that you don't have to smoke it! That was the main thing everyone I had spoken with was concerned about, the rolling of the joint.  You can throw in things about the different methods. Patches (expensive but fantastic), lotion, gummies, baked goods, butter that you can throw in the pan to baste onto a steak, dry herb vape, a ton of options for duration, quickness, efficiency, etc. 

If they want to move forward, you can start talking about high CBD/low THC strains from a dispensary if you have them nearby. 

For pain relief, I prefer super high CBD (instead of THC) and if your aunt is older you may not want to have to work around any mind effects with regards to balance or brain fog.  A racing heart can also be a concern on some strains if there is an issue there. 

I have also brought over samples before. One or two of each of the gummies I like and say okay, give these a shot. Let me know if you like it and we can go from there.  It is a no pressure way to end it and it gives them an option to change their mind after the conversation without having to come back and say ""okay how do we do this""

Some comments I used frequently.

I do not have a vested interest in this, I just want for you to feel better. If you choose to use it or not I do not care in either way. I just want you know it is an option to explore. 
Shit nobody cares. 
Do what you have to do to make it easier on you. 
If the Dr had a pill that would fix it I'd take that in a second so I figured I'd give this a shot.
If heroin would fix the pain on bad days I'd be fine with that too if I was 80, shit I feel like you should get licenses to do better things as you age.

*Most Frequent Mode of Ingestion*: Replaceable CO2 distillate cartridge in a vape pen. I get away with this inside during the winter.  Problem is that the high is one-dimensional.

*Less Frequent:* Arizer Solo II. Not bad, not one dimensional - just takes a while. Sesh is like 30-40 minutes. Because of odor, this means outdoors? A sesh that long is not okay in the winter.

I wake up exhausted, have a coffee, pretend I'm awake for an hour -- fail -- then go back to napping for another 4-6 hours. The 12-14 hours of sleep necessary is not cool.

jdrhq4f,migraine,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"I have found that efficacy of gummies, and edibles in general, is all over the map from ineffective and giving me a headache to wildly over powered with THC (which is okay unless I'm in the middle of actual plans, which will then surely be discarded lol).  But the variation in **quality** is what gets me the most - I'm not the only one who has gotten headaches from bad edibles/extract.  There can be enough contaminants in extract to pass testing requirements and still mess up your experience with something like a, while not deadly, super uncomfortable migraine or strange nervous system aches/triggers.

I would like to say that the dosage across any edible is homogenous so you can just divide it up, but in truth you're buying blind.  I wish I could give you more confidence.  I don't think the standards for ""cleanliness"" of extract are stringent enough here (Oregon) and I am unsure how you would find those same contaminants once extract is distributed amongst an entire batch of edibles.

I eventually just gave up on dispensary edibles and learned to make a few types of my own from clean weed of medicinal strains; I know the weed is okay here because it's tested and I can smoke it prior to concentrating it (and any contaminants) into extract for use in the kitchen.

Sure I'm stuck eating only the things I make but my edibles experience is always dialed in tight and others I'm with appreciate the same when I share them.   Sometimes I want a wild night but most of the time I want to have control over my meds and keep the flow even keeled.

l1tde9e,discomfort,comment,saplings_raw_data,"A great line I once heard from a friend‚Äîsometimes weed quits us before we quit it. It really captures how our relationship with cannabis can evolve, often beyond our control. As our bodies and circumstances change, so can the way we react to it.

Switching up the strains might help, focusing on those with a higher CBD to THC ratio, or even opting for just CBD, which is less likely to trigger anxiety. Cutting back on the quantity might also do the trick, giving your body a chance to reset.

Also, since the legalization, one of the significant advantages has been the ability to know exactly how much THC you're consuming, especially with edibles. This precise dosing can really help manage how intense your experience is, making it easier to avoid too much, which can lead to anxiety or discomfort. Edibles provide a different type of high, often more intense and longer-lasting, so starting with a low dose and going slow is key to finding what works best for you.

And one more tip, switching to a dry herb vaporizer can also make a big difference. Vaping tends to provide a cleaner high compared to smoking. It heats the cannabis at a lower temperature than burning it, which means you get more of the beneficial compounds without the harmful byproducts of smoke. Many (r/vaporents) find that vaping results in a smoother, less anxiety-inducing experience. It‚Äôs also easier on the lungs and can be more efficient in using your herb, which helps both financially and health-wise.

This site seems to be saying that cannabis causes respiratory issues like cigarettes, which is typically untrue unless people smoke a whole lot. 

The few studies that supposedly pointed to testicular cancer is not referenced and likely BS. The human endocannabinoid system helps the body naturally kill cancer cells. THC directly applied can shrink tumors. 

Obviously pregnant women shouldn‚Äôt take cannabis, but serious birth defects? No. It‚Äôs not alcohol. The reference study says there may be some problem solving issues, but other studies show an uptick in personableness with children of cannabis users. 

Finally, the anti-inflammatory action of cannabinoids help decrease heart disease, which is caused in part by inflammation. 

Cannabis isn‚Äôt without negative side effects, but it‚Äôs not the narcotic that some sources make it to be. Many, many people find relief and motivation from it. They treat their conditions with it.

lj7231e,anxiety,comment,petioles_raw_data,"My husband was a daily smoker for most of his twenties until he had a panic attack and quit because of a new anxiety diagnosis- weed just didn‚Äôt make him feel good anymore. He had no THC for probably a good 5 years. 

Less than a year ago, he was prescribed trazodone as he historically cannot sleep at all. He was needing more and more trazodone + melatonin and felt like a zombie in the AMs, so he restarted THC but with edibles. He takes like 10-20mg/night most nights and ditched the trazodone. Other than sleep, He will occasionally take an edible for fun if he knows he‚Äôs solo for the night and will like order a pizza and game- very nostalgic for him. He‚Äôs in his mid-30s now. He is a very disciplined person now compared to his twenties so, while he has an addictive personality, he is very intentional with his usage to avoid a slippery slope and has been successful. 

Overall he has had a great experience! He was nervous to introduce it again, as he was happy otherwise and didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat, but reintroducing weed has helped his sleep without taking over his life/every activity like it did in his twenties.

From my experience if you're trying to help deal with mental and psychological issues with anxiety and panic issues. 

Then I'd highly recommend stacking CBD and CBN together.

So you'll take CBD tincture throughout the day to help mitigate things anxiety. It will calm your nervous system and allow you to be more in a parasympathetic state.

And as it gets closer to the evening you take CBN. CBN is one of the most sedating and anxiety relieving cannabinoids you can take. I've noticed when I take CBN it is more anxiety reducing than even CBD.

So what I'll do is I'll take one gummy of CBN+CBD deep sleep gummy from herbal garden essentials. It also has L-theanine and melatonin in them so it drastically helps reduce anxiety and insomnia.  Highly recommend these gummies

L-theanine switches the brain into a alpha brain wave which is known for deep relaxation and a meditative like state.

So use CBD and CBN but also stack in some other supplements and herbs.

The first high was a sedated high and it took me ever to get there. I had a Blackberry Kush cart that was part D8 I was brand new, had only had two previous experiences with the plant. One was with Hawaiian Haze to kill a migraine (it worked) and one was unknown also to kill a migraine (also worked and why I became med patient.).

I puffed in that damn thing abt 5 times and felt zero, got on the net seeking info. Discovered D8 doesn't get you high. It did have some D9 in it so I just kept puffing away. It took probably 15 puffs and suddenly I felt a little drowsy. I stand up and head to bed. Uh... OK. I can't walk straight. Better hang on to the wall, the dresser, the chest, the bed I collapsed into bed.

Did I sleep? Nope I was far too aroused! My first experienced with this strain I discovered how awesome weed and sex go together if you get the right strain for you. Gentle kick to hubs. He didn't mind. It's always more fun with a partner for me.

The first sedating body high I remember was Northern Lights cart. Ahh, such a lovely strain huh? It really does feel like a heavy blanket is on you keeping you all safe and warm. I saw fun colors and shapes then was asleep for the first 6 hrs of sleep I had had in many years.

I Finally started a weed break this tuesday (been on my mind for so many months) and was planning to allow myself to smoke only on fridays and saturdays but you know what... I'm taking a whole month off like you before getting back to it. Let's get it!!

My tips : 

1) Embrace the harder parts as part of the process.

I finally had a great night sleep yesterday although still alot of sweating. Used a bunch of otc sleep aids and guided meditation before bed.

2) Put your stash away not easy to reach.

lv7s2uv,tossing and turning,comment,entwives_raw_data,"Day 7 of my t break and to anyone reading this and struggling let me give you a few tips that helped me because believe me it took a lot of failed attempts to even make it a week.

My first tip and this one youve probably heard a lot but was definately most effective was: Dont have access to get high. What i mean by that is once youve run out of weed or whatever it is you use to get high with, once youve finisher off that batch dont get more. If you dont have it its pyshically impossible to get high and boy did it help me. I thought i could have self control or some self discipline and tried many t breaks while still having access to thc and i had every excuse under the sun why i should smoke after 2 or 3 days of not. Once i got rid of everythings theres no excuses and i feel more confident since if i do want to smoke i have to go thru the whole process of messaging the plug, meeting with them, taking money out which gives you time to properly think before buying your next lot.

My second tip: if you consume by smoking i know theyre not the safest or best for you but nicotine vapes really helped me a lot. Whenevrr i have an urge to get high i just sesh on my nicotine pen and it doesnt givr you any type of high (maybe nicotine rushes if youre not used to nicotine) but it definately gave me something else to do and was good enough for me.

My third tip: this might not be fot everyone but for me my goal by the end of this is to finally have some wicked highs again but also learn ti moderate. The thought of how amazing my next high will be keeps me going as if i break my t break now it wont be nowhere near as enjoyable as it would be at the one month mark. For me its enough to keep me going as i havent had a good high in a while.

The biggest thing i faced and i think a lot of people do is the insomnia. For me i dont have cbd or any other type of medicine or supplement to help me sleep so i literally dont sleep one night and the next im so tired i knock straight out. Its not ideal but its the only way i can get any sleep in as it i try sleep everynight i just find myself tossing and turning for hours.


To everyone taking a t break or even considering it im proud of you all and im glad i have this community to share my experience and to learn from your guys experience.

We grew up in the midst of ""Just Say No"", and at least where I went to school the ""stoners"" were the kids who wore dark trenchcoats and hung out by themselves, ridiculed by most of their classmates.  Cannabis wasn't something that people were open about, at least in my social circles, even when I was in University -- it just never came up.

I have to admit to having been fairly closed minded about it until I discovered that it was helpful for medical uses, and my username attests to that.  I had ""never climbed a tree"" 4.5 years ago before making this account, and was a complete newbie.  And then I discovered the joy and miracle of various strains, from pain relief, to symptom relief for Tourette Syndrome, to better sex, to just plain joy of sitting back and having food taste better, music sound better, and movies be funnier.

A while after I started using it, my wife reluctantly gave it a try for insomnia after having never used it before, and now she's equally enamored by it.  She says that it saved her life, plus enjoys the feeling, and has become an advocate and tried and tried to encourage multiple people to give it a try for various ailments, and they have all refuse to even consider it.

So, here we are, surrounded by people who just completely refuse to even consider it -- in a legal state, where we've had legal medical cannabis for 25 years!!

Worse, we're still living in a time where our employers test new employees, and we cannot be open about it.  Even though I work in tech, where I'm constantly reading comments about how ""everybody in tech"" uses it, I've never had any indication of it.  Maybe I'm the old guy that they're afraid to mention it to, maybe I also project that image of somebody who's not open to it too?  (which seems odd since I have long hair, a beard, frequently talk about (edible) mushroom foraging in Mendocino, and sleep in a DIY campervan when I'm at the office) Back to the culture thing -- no way that I'll broach the subject at work, which drives me nuts.  We can all go to a bar together after work (pre COVID, of course), and have some drinks, and some of them, managers included, stumble out of the bar while I limit myself to one or two, but I fear exposing myself for enjoying a little flower.

I‚Äôm reaching out to seek support for a cause that‚Äôs close to many of our hearts.

Its been 4 days since i was high but i feel weird, not completly sober, i feel slight nausea, dizziness and maybe a little high (very little just a touch)

it was a weird mixture of desire and fear, but not even proper desire tho bc I kept panicking thinking about how I'd start overthinking so much. Before I would usually only smoke alone bc of this, so I was stressing about being able to actually talk let alone converse normally. I also kept thinking how disappointed and demotivated I'd be if i reset all my progress back to zero. anyways luckily they didn't offer to me, I was smoking a cigarette to alleviate cravings and I think they just assumed I was good which was a MASSIVE fucking relief. I explained to my friend after who totally understood and we laughed about it briefly.

the main takeaway I wanted to write was waking up the next day and remembering i'd averted all that guilt was a high in of itself. even though it was kind of accidental luck that saved me from myself lol, I'm grateful for the experience to have taught me what it did. that I really really DONT actually want to go back to this, it's just my fucking impulsivity that was raring for a dopamine hit or something. ie the shortest relief for the longest fuckery of guilt, self-hatred, losing trust in myself and respect alongside - all that crap is NOT worth it. keep going yall, i've found every day more and more worth it",0,high_disagreement,1

Your dopamine is spent, but you're still high, so don't be surprised if you're on edge about things.

You probably had a bad gut reaction to the edible, and that could have been exacerbated by both the caffeine and the aspirin. Honestly though, while it doesn't sound fun, it does sound like you did the right things.

lb24mv5,can't breathe,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"Give an exhale and take ten deep, slow breaths any time you feel stressed or anxious, and count the breaths.

Stress hormones intensify the feeling of stress and anxiety and they are broken-down by oxygen.

Deep breathing brings oxygen into the body, and deep, slow breathing slows the heart rate and reduces activity in the amygdala, emotional response fear center, and increases activity in the hippocampus, memory writing and recall center.

Give an exhale, first, because trying to take a deep breath while there is air in your lungs can feel like you can't breathe, which will add to stress.

ljr1avc,overwhelmed,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"The primary cannabinoid responsible for cannabis causing impairment is THC.  Here's the gist of why: 

**1. How THC Affects the Brain:**

THC interacts with your brain‚Äôs endocannabinoid system, which plays a big role in things like mood, memory, and movement. When THC binds to certain receptors in your brain, it interferes with how these functions usually work, typically causing signals to overwhelm the circuits you normally depend on being quieter and smooth pathways (think interruption by other activity more than signals stopping)

**2. Memory and Learning:**

THC affects the hippocampus, the part of your brain that helps form new memories. This is why, when you‚Äôre high, you might have trouble remembering things or learning new information. Depending on how much you consume and how regularly, this is usually only temporary for intermittent consumers.

**3. Coordination and Motor Skills:**

THC also impacts the parts of your brain that control movement and coordination, like the cerebellum. This can make your reaction times slower and your motor skills less sharp, which is why tasks like driving become much more dangerous. Again, this is more about signals overwhelming your system with cross-pollination rather than reducing the volume on the whole machine.

**4. Judgment and Decision-Making:**

The prefrontal cortex, which helps with decision-making and judgment, is another area that THC affects. This can impair your ability to make safe decisions or accurately assess situations, leading to potentially risky behavior. 

**5. Changes in Perception:**

THC can change how you perceive time, sounds, colors, and space. This altered perception can make everyday activities, like driving, much more challenging and risky.

**6. Dopamine Release:**

THC also triggers the release of dopamine, the ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù chemical in your brain. While this contributes to the euphoria or ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù it can also lower your inhibitions and affect your decision-making because you're in a pleasant headspace.

**7. Everyone‚Äôs Different:**

The level of impairment varies from person to person. Things like how strong the cannabis is, how you consume it, your tolerance level, and even your mood can influence how impaired you become.

In a nutshell, cannabis causes impairment by affecting key areas of your brain responsible for memory, coordination, judgment, and perception. This is why it‚Äôs important to be cautious with activities that require focus and precision, like driving, when you‚Äôre under the influence of cannabis. Understanding how cannabinoids impact your brain can help you make safer choices about when and how to use it.

I‚Äôm currently doing that. I said nothing about stopping my break before the 21 days and even mentioned near the end of my post that I‚Äôll see how I‚Äôm feeling at the end of the 21 days and whether or not I want to go further‚Ä¶

I also never said I *only* used weed for medical reasons, I said I tend to use it to help with chronic pain. I also use it as a general stress reliever, and I live in an abusive household so weed is one of my coping mechanisms. My living in an abusive household is why I relapsed on September 1st, I got extremely overwhelmed and after trying to utilize all of my other coping skills, they did not work so I relapsed and started my break over again the next day. I never said I get high every time I‚Äôm sad or lonely. I enjoy my own company quite a bit and I don‚Äôt consider it a bad thing that I‚Äôll be alone on my birthday, I just feel that getting high would be a fun way to spend a special day.

And to answer your questions, yes I have reevaluated my relationship with weed, moving forward I plan on using it in moderation whenever I do end my break rather than using it in excess like I was doing before the break started. Evaluating my relationship with weed is something I will also continue to do after my break, I plan on journaling every time I do take edibles, asking myself why I got high, etc. I believe my tolerance will be reset at the end of the 21 days as well, which is why I‚Äôd feel comfortable ending it‚Ä¶",0,high_disagreement,1

yyo8rj,heart pounding,post,eldertrees_raw_data,"Inner work with weed If you look at the way the psychedelic experience of weed is usually portrayed, it often comes across as a rather blunt and simple thing. Of course, nobody who never tried any psychedelic can have the slightest idea of *why* other people find it so fascinating, they assume something out of their own experiential reality. Often, they implicitly associate some sort of numbness with the experience, which of course is ridiculous. 

The most accurate way of describing the experience, that is kind of ""agreed-upon"" by uers and non-users, is that it is a way to ""relax"".

Yes, there's a bodily aspect to it. But it's so much more, isn't it?
Here's a little attempt of a description about why and how I actually use weed.

So does it relax me? Yes, well certainly not in the way it seems from the outside.
I'd rather say that it relaxes my usual criteria for what is important and what isn't. For what's ""worth my attention"".

There are sooo many things in my blind spot all the time as I go about my life. Maybe they're worth checking out.

Example time: The Sauna. I was already 30 when I went into a sauna for the first time in my life. Why? Well my parents didn't go with me, so the idea of going to a sauna simply never occurred to me. I knew *about* saunas, but they were an entirely empty, lifeless concept with zero appeal.

Well when I finally went I was quite amazed by the experience. That feeling of going really hot and then submerging yourself in a bucket of ice water for a while. Getting out on to some terrace in a winter's night, naked, steaming. Stars twinkling above. Absolutely immune to the cold. Feeling my heart pounding in my entire body like a powerful drum. Wow. I mean *that's* what life is all about isn't it? Totally a psychedelic experience of it's own caliber.

And just like that there are so, so many possible experiences ""out there"" that we simply don't know about. Drastic ones and subtle ones.

When I'm high and do whatever, I start noticing  glimpses of *why* certain things exist. Like today, I was listening to some podcast when the topic went into the direction of sacral music. And I never, never listened to sacral music. It's just like with the sauna.

So I tuned in to some music like [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/2X2kviHQUtSDG5WlXhzXjd?si=Eh3ScBK8Rkm2KnV9jxQGlQ&utm_source=copy-link), felt into it, and it kind of dawned on me that the reason this kind of music exists is that it facilitates a unique experience. The experience of feeling close to something divine. Something that loves us unconditionally and in a certain sense ""is always, always there for us"". It's a feeling on a level that can never be captured by words. Long before people had languages, they already had music. Who knows, the entire animal kingdom may be filled with its own version of music. It's all about a dance between regular and irregular. Patterns of order dancing with chaos.

Well, so that would be a mundane and a profound example of ""widening my horizon"". And in order to widen my horizon I need to relax. And weed helps me with that. Relax what? Well that's the question isn't it? And the answer isn't ""myself"", it's actually ""my self"". It's just like it says so beautifully in the Daode Jing:

> Pursue knowledge, gain daily. Pursue Tao, lose daily. Lose and again lose, Arrive at non-doing.

> Non-doing - and nothing not done.

> Take the entire world as nothing. 

> Make the least effort, And the world escapes you.

In a way, the entire world is full of meaning. And it's a kind of tension, a kind constant inner ""effort"" that creates all of our blind spots. That tension is channeled into ""doing"" all the time. And while we're busy with that, the world appears to us in a fragmented way, metaphorically ""through the mask of our egos"". All because we make a difference between good and bad. Between good or bad for the future as we envision it and the reality as *is is*. As long as we're trying to get anywhere, we don't see shit.  *Everything* that exists, exists has actually something to tell us, something worth discovering. Everything exists, represents itself to us, because it was in fact *inevitable* and it expresses a truth that cannot be put into words. A truth that that very thing's existence is an expression of. That truth has to do with the history of the universe, cause and effect bla bla, but also a whole lot with ourselves. It's only the coming-together of the two that ""releases"" it.

Well the effect isn't permanent of course. But something stays. An hint of why something, anything has it's own inner truthfulness. A lingering inspiration to check out this or that when sober. And often I follow up on that. Read some book of a genre I've never had on my radar. Listen to new kinds of music. From time to time I even actually do something physically.. because that's where reality actually really happens. So in this way I'd totally say that weed allows me to do some meaningful inner work. The inner work of letting go and relaxing the effort to get anywhere and seeing right through it. I'd say it totally enriched my experience of the world so far.",0,high_disagreement,1

I made it 453 days without smoking/consuming THC and threw it all away. I guess I was far enough out from it that when I was gifted a gummy, I took it with little hesitation; I didn't buy it- I justified it by saying ""it's just because it's right in front of me. It's just this once.""

It wasn't. It was like a whole month of hitting a disposable I bought two weeks after that edible.

I woke up nauseous this morning and dry-heaved. I suddenly remembered one of the reasons I quit at first was because I was getting nauseous and was scared to death of CHS. I cried in my bathroom and realized what I was doing to myself. I re-downloaded a counter app, drank water, ate a good breakfast, and went to work with the realization I have to start over on this journey.

Here I am at 24 hours without smoking. I don't think that the physical withdrawal symptoms will hit me quite like they did when I was using every day for several years, but I still dread what is to come.

I spent tonight at the gym, did some yoga, ate a healthy dinner, and am spending time on this sub to help re-orient my mind. I'm actually so worried about how hard this time might be because I may not experience the terrible withdrawal symptoms that helped me realize just what I was doing to my body.

Good vibes and encouragement are appreciated. Here's to day 0 and the days to come.",0,high_disagreement,1

headuah,sweating,comment,eldertrees_raw_data,"> If you feel the mental fog is worth the depression relief, go for it. 

For me, my depression is causing mental fog. Depression relief leads to less fog for me, even when Cannabis is used as a temporary solution.

> could potentially amplify negative thoughts which gets worse if you don't have steady access to cannabis or the means to.

For me it is the other way around. I get myself a big toke when intrusive thoughts are not manageable anymore. My physician as well as my psychologist know this and approve it. I've talked with my psychologist about my use, and she says it's absolutely fine and seems to help me.

Using weed can break an episode of intrusive thoughts. It relaxes me, releasing tension throughout the body, which of course helps. Sometimes I need some external help to get to that place. Not all the time, and I'm not using it as quickly as possible, but when it gets worse and worse, I know I can try to use weed. Doesn't work all the time, but at least makes it more manageable, and mostly works quite well.

I'm not really seeing how this could get worse when you don't have access to a steady supply. Cannabis helps when I use it, but doesn't make my situation any worse when I'm not using it, if you know what I mean.


> Physical activity, consuming certain vitamins and changes to lifestyle.

For light depression these things work. For middle or heavy depression, you can't just train your body out of depression. And for some, sport is next to impossible when you're even sweating from just walking up the stairs because your body is so tense all day that you'll end up with sore muscles anyway.

And no, this is not me being fat or unathlethic. My depression hit me really hard when it started. The sweating was immediately a problem, even when I was normally fit just weeks before. But that's sadly what most physicians don't know about, and that lead to many doctors thinking I'm  just a lazy guy wanting to have pills.

...which was REALLY harmful for the development of my illness. Imagine you are having a really bad time, and your illness is so unknown that professionals constantly misdiagnose you.

I had to work with my doctor a lot to find a solution that lets me sleep regularly and soundly. We wound up at an SNRI that is used to treat anxiety but which happens to induce drowsiness. If I take it at night, it shuts down the anxious part of my brain and encourages me to lie down, and I don't get woken up by crazy dreams. But to get to that point, I had to try melatonin (no effect), a muscle relaxer (caused terrible nightmares), and an SSRI (destroyed my stomach, made me suicidal).

ldstu20,nightmares,comment,marijuana_raw_data,"Prolonged cannabis use produces both pharmacokinetic changes (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) and pharmacodynamic changes (how the drug interacts with target cells) to the body. These changes require the user to consume higher doses of the drug to achieve a common desirable effect (known as a higher tolerance), reinforcing the body's metabolic systems for eliminating the drug more efficiently and further down-regulating cannabinoid receptors in the brain.[10]

Cannabis users have shown decreased reactivity to dopamine, suggesting a possible link to a dampening of the reward system of the brain and an increase in negative emotion and addiction severity.[11]

Cannabis users can develop tolerance to the effects of THC. Tolerance to the behavioral and psychological effects of THC has been demonstrated in adolescent humans and animals.[12][13] The mechanisms that create this tolerance to THC are thought to involve changes in cannabinoid receptor function.[12]

One study has shown that between 2001‚Äì2002 and 2012‚Äì2013, the use of marijuana in the US doubled.[14]

Cannabis dependence develops in about 9% of users, significantly less than that of heroin, cocaine, alcohol, and prescribed anxiolytics,[15] but slightly higher than that for psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD.[16] Of those who use cannabis daily, 10‚Äì20% develop dependence.[17]



Cannabis withdrawal symptoms occur in half of people being treated for cannabis use disorders.[18] Symptoms may include dysphoria, anxiety, irritability, depression, restlessness, disturbed sleep, gastrointestinal symptoms, and decreased appetite. 

It is often paired with rhythmic movement disorder. Most symptoms begin during the first week of abstinence and resolve after a few weeks.[6] About 12% of heavy cannabis users showed cannabis withdrawal as defined by the DSM-5, and this was associated with significant disability as well as mood, anxiety and personality disorders.


[19] Furthermore, a study on 49 dependent cannabis users over a two week period of abstinence proved most prominently symptoms of nightmares (although lacking distress in subjects) and anger issues (causing distress).

The most important thing is making sure you're drinking plenty of water. I find myself with complications sometimes when I cough really bad and it leaves me with a headache and throwing up sometimes. This is just your body's natural resistance pushing out allergens and dust as well alongside the annoying throat irritation. There have been studies that popped up recently showing that cannabis users were much higher candidates for stroke and other blood related issues, and your liver does have to do extra work to metabolize cannabinoids.

I'd hesitate to take cbg by itself, as I find better effects when combining with other cannabinoids, primarily CBD and THC.

lfczj5n,heart pounding,comment,treedibles_raw_data,First off apologies for responding so much later but i dont ever recommend taking a drug to make another drug better as thats a slippery slope. Metoprolol is a very selective beta channel blocker that i started for a separate reason than to take stress off the heart from cannabis. I think its minimally risky as its one of the more selective beta blockers that doesn‚Äôt have a lot other effects on the body. Cannabis in human studies has unfortunately shown to increase heart attack risk and stroke risk(i will add this could be related to the negatives of combustion smoking and may not account for other ways of enjoying the plant) and metoprolol is prescribed as preventative care for further heart attacks amongst many other reasons. I think its not a bad idea if its a tolerable medication for an individual and im on half of the lowest prescribed dose to manage my pots diagnosis and it had the added benefit of reducing the heart pounding and light headedness that cannabis caused for me. I see it more as a harm reduction approach to the cardiovascular negatives of cannabis and this could be particularly helpful in regular recreational/medical users since we see less off days than the average user and may have a higher chance of heart attack long term.

Awesome hobby, would love to turn it into a business but, alas it seems that most legal states made license application so expensive that it keeps out the little fish.
If you decide to grow I suggest growing in living soil, 3-5 gallon fabric pots, handwater with nonchlorinated water, top dress with worm castings during bloom phase, and run autoflowers with good genetics. Nightowl, speedrun, mephisto are all good choices for seed. That will keep it simple and ""cheaper"" for your first grow.

Male - 25 years old  
Casual smoking since 18 years old (2016)  
All day everyday smoke since 2020 and stopped all day everyday smoking on 5th April 2023

Hello,

This is my progress report as of 16months and 3weeks of quitting smoking all day everyday. I'm here to report that sadly I have had a handful of slip-ups that I don't know to count as 'relapse' or not. In the past few months since my progress report which was in May I have taken up weekend smoking and have continued once a week on the weekend smoking since June up to August 18th which was last two weeks.

In the time that I was gone a lot has happened, two of the main things that happened since my last progress report was I've picked up weekend once/twice a week smoking again as well as I travelled overseas and smoked weed and drank till I was passed out drunk at a club overseas.

Before you guys roast me, I know why would I go back to smoking when PAWS gave me absolute hell for 12 months straight and continues to make me uncomfortable up to today. Well to tell you the truth I had 2 objectives in mind when I decided that I would try smoking again. **Objective 1** was to test out the stability of my mind and to see whether smoking will induce a state of panic/extreme anxiety or am I able to enjoy weed like how I used to and **Objective 2** was to test out whether my dopamine as well as endocannabinoid receptors were still fried or not.

**Objective 1**  
Initially I wanted to try smoking to see if my mind was back to normal or whether I would spiral into an anxious mess and initially I was indeed anxious but I soon realised this was more of a self-induced type of anxiousness instead of being anxious for no reason like how we feel during PAWS. It was the thought of being anxious from smoking that made me anxious during the smoking if you know what I mean. As the weeks went on and I continued this once/twice a week smoke sesh with my friends I started to realise I was not so much anxious from smoking but anxious from self induced anxiousness from the overthinking of ""what if I get anxious while smoking"".

Through this I've confirmed that my mind is indeed on it's way back to being normal as I am able to rationalise my anxiety in a way that I couldn't earlier on in my PAWS journey and this gave be a boost of morale that signalled to me that full 100% healing may soon be around the corner.

**Objective 2**  
With objective 2 my main goal was to figure out whether internally were my receptors still fried from the years long abuse or not and to pull this off I had self-experimented with smoking back to back for 2 days straight and to my surprise I would say that my receptors are largely healed but not healed all the way. How did I come to this prognosis that my endocannabinoid as well as dopamine receptors aren't fully healed yet was because in the time that I was away I actually travelled overseas for a short holiday and I went clubbing again for the first time since my PAWS journey started.

This trip for me was crucial in helping me determine that my receptors have indeed largely healed but not all the way as early on in my PAWS journey I could not consume any alcohol at all and any alcohol consumption would lead me to feel extreme anxiety and DP/DR the next day. However during my trip I got blacked out drunk from clubbing and slamming liqour and the next day and though I felt horrible I didn't experience any of my early PAWS psychological symptoms like DP/DR, anxiety, etc. I just felt like how I normally would before PAWS after a night out of heavy drinking which was fatigue and low mood.

**Conclusion**  
To end this progress report and for the sake of putting a number on how I feel overall for those that are curious I would say from my last progress report of 97% healed I would confidently say that I'm at a good 98% to 98.5% healed and the reason for this is because I still have the odd anxiety here and there that has never existed before PAWS but I can feel it melt away ever so slowly.

Granted that there are still situations where I would find myself rather anxious, jittery, intrusive thoughts hitting and constantly checking my heart rate like early on in my PAWS but there are moments where I would fight the anxiousness by facing it straight on and not giving into the anxiety and intrusive thoughts.

As for smoking, I think I'm gonna stop the once/twice a week smoking for now till I'm confident enough to say that I'm 100% healed and whether or not I will indulge in the occasional smoke after I have healed 100% has yet to be decided but I can say that I am grateful for everything that has happened this past 16**¬æ** months as I've learnt a lot about myself and I feel that I actively continue to improve everyday.

To those that are still early on in their PAWS struggle or for those that are deeper in the struggle than me but still continue to feel horrible I'd like to tell you to keep fighting the good fight and have hope that one day it'll all end. I can feel the end of my suffering coming soon and though you may not feel the same way please know that time will heal and eventually this will all be a distant memory.

Thank you to those that read my long progress reports and sincerely thank you for those that have recovered but continue to stay to keep people suffering like me and many others hope that this indeed will end.

All the best my fellow warriors and till next the next progress report ! <3

How much, how often etc.  I sort of make myself crazy.  I have an anxiety disorder so ruminating is a problem for me.  I scare myself into thinking maybe I am an addict so I quit for awhile.  Then I realize that I was likely just in my head and dip my toe back in the water.  I was asking a friend what she thinks yesterday. She said she thinks I don‚Äôt actually have an addiction, but I‚Äôm so afraid of it that I freak myself out.  I only smoke at night, after I get all my stuff done  etc. part of me thinks I should just give it up completely and be done with it, but my husband smokes so I like to join him. I have recently started mixing it with CBD to make it not as strong. Anyway I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has had this experience. I‚Äôve gone 5 days so far this time.  I smoked 4 days before that and 3-4 days off before that. I have had a lot of vacation time, so my thought about just keeping to weekends got thrown off a bit.

gq3asts,"afraid,anxiety,anxious,overwhelmed,panic",,trees,"Tbh I can get that, it's not as ridiculous as it sounds. But I have an anxiety disorder so it's probably mostly that.

It's just that coke mainly makes you feel awake, motivated and confident and ketamine, while very intense, is an anxiolytic and sedating so usually you won't really get freaked out when it's too much for you.

Weed on the other hand is much closer to psychedelics than people imagine, it's just way easier to take too much, get anxious and overwhelmed and since it amplifies your feelings just like a psychedelic you can easily end up in a cycle where your fears get worse and worse and you're having a panic attack or getting really paranoid.     
But tbh I wouldn't say I'm ""afraid"" of it, I'm just more careful to only consume as much as I can handle now.      
I guess you could call that being a bit afraid ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

or7uni,"afraid,anxiety,sleep",,leaves,"Weed and Self-Sabotage. Very interesting! | Hey guys, hope you‚Äôre all well. 

Psychology student here and I recently learnt a new concept which I found super interesting. 

The concept is called ‚Äúself-handicapping‚Äù, sometimes also referred to as ‚Äúself-sabotaging‚Äù.

‚ÄúSelf-handicapping has been commonly defined as actively seeking or creating situations which will interfere with performance and therefore create an explanation for possible failure outside of individual ability attributions‚Äù 

For example, say there‚Äôs a student who has a very important test the next day and they‚Äôre afraid they won‚Äôt do well. 
They might decide to join their friends and party the night before the test instead of revising. 
Why? 
So that when they get their grade back and see that they didn‚Äôt do well, their brain instantly goes ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt do well because of your friends and that party‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt do well because you‚Äôre not that intelligent and you have a poor work ethic‚Äù. 

Self handicapping serves as a means of protecting the fragile human ego by shifting the blame of any prospective failure onto external factors rather than internal ones. 
It serves to preserve our self esteem. 

Does this sound familiar? 

Allow me to give you another example, this time linked to weed. 

Say there‚Äôs a person who has had social anxiety their whole life. Since discovering weed, they‚Äôve developed a habit of smoking before social gatherings. 
Logically, this makes no sense. Why would they use a substance that impairs social skills if they already have poor social skills?
The answer is simple. 
Without weed, their poor social skills will be internalised and become damaging to their self esteem. The individual will be painfully aware of their awkwardness and will therefore be more self conscious of how others perceive them, too. 
With weed, the person‚Äôs social awkwardness will be attributed to the fact that they‚Äôre high. They will be less self conscious too, because they know that everyone else knows they‚Äôre high and will therefore link the person‚Äôs poor social skills to the weed rather than them personally. 

After some thought, I realised that I use weed to self-sabotage so many different areas of my life. 
It‚Äôs a lot easier to live with yourself as a person when you shake off personal responsibility and instead find something in the world to blame. 

Yes, it‚Äôs so comfortable keeping myself wrapped in cotton wool. I make it through the day easier, I sleep better at night. 
But my life will never change if I continue like this. 10 years from now, I‚Äôll either be stuck in exactly the same place or I‚Äôll be in a worse place. 

The only way out is through. I need to unwrap the cotton wool, take a long hard look in the mirror, take responsibility for my actions, and finally reclaim control over my life. 

Staying comfortable will never lead to growth. 
Staying complacent will never lead to change.",0,chanda_solo,1
liql8lp,"afraid,anxiety,hurt,pain,sleep,soreness,stress",,leaves,"Just passed a month, the longest I've gone without it since I had an injury a few years ago, and getting close to the longest I've gone in the 17 years I've smoked.

I've tried tapering down. It never works. At some point you'll just buy more and keep putting it off, or something bad will happen (as things do in life) that'll get you to say ""OK, well this happened and I need to sleep, soo...""

This time I'm done. My mentality needed to change. I'm not treating it as something so extremely hard, yet keeping the quitting part very serious. I still have weed here, pens I can attach to my vape, leaves I can pack into a bowl, and bowls and bongs I can use. Still here, right where I left them.

The difference is I tell myself now ""this is my alcoholism, and that is my beer."" Sure, alcoholism is way more dangerous and harder to get over, but not for me, and it helped put things in perspective. I can't have a little. I can't taper off. I can't just smoke socially like everyone else around me. I can't say ""well, maybe EVENTUALLY I can do it socially..."" That's giving the addiction power over you. This is my alcoholism, and that it my beer.

What got me to put it down was realizing that despite the hold it has over me, despite the mental push I have to smoke, despite all the power I've given it... at the end of the day, quitting is literally as simple as just *not smoking it*. Not putting the weed in the bowl, not lighting it, not inhaling. It's as simple as just... not doing it and carrying on. 

It's all about the power you give the *addiction* itself. 

Things I've noticed since quitting:

1- For the first time in my life I have ambitions. I'm no longer okay with just working enough to be able to pay bills and eat. I'm maybe a few weeks away from being ready to start my own small LLC and have been researching the process and insurances I would need, on top of business cards and a uniform, and talks with places that would hand out my cards and help get me clients. This would've never started with stoner me, and now I'm just waiting for the funds to pull the trigger on it. My mind is on that more than the sweet game I just downloaded or a movie I'm excited about.


2- The things I love I still love, but in different and more powerful ways. I love videogames, always have, and I was afraid I wouldn't like them as much sober. I can't really get myself to play the more mindless ones nowadays, but I've traded that for diving into a story and characters more. I ask questions in BG3, I'm reading notes in Guild Wars 2, and I just re-downloaded red dead 2 to see how much more I can get from what is imo the greatest story a game has ever told. Last night I watched The Godfather pt2, a movie I'd seen hundreds of times, and I swear there were so many things I just never cared to pick up on before bc I was always blasted watching it, so much so that I realized i like that movie way more than pt1 now.


3- I'm starting to cook for myself. I was always okay with just making sandwiches. For years and years that all I did. Various forms of sandwiches or fast food. Last week I was craving a burger. As I was about to leave to go to Culver's, as I always do when I want a burger, I stopped myself and said ""you know what? Let's make a burger. I can still use the onions, tomatoes, lettuce for other things, I need mayo anyways... let's go make one,"" and I fucking did. It was spicy, it was juicy, and my heart wasn't leaping out of my chest from all the butter and bad shit. 


4- I can focus and handle anxiety, pick up on social queues, and rethink things better than I ever could before. When I thought I needed weed to slow my mind down, I realized I was just becoming zombified in a fog. I sat on a bench the other day, smoked a cig, and wondered about the light reflecting from the river, what that butterfly's tiny mind was thinking as it fluttered past me, how the wind blowing past can feel so good on my skin, and what that feeling might actually be. Thoughts my stoned mind would've NEVER had. Before I would've sat there like a lump of fat cooking in the sun with a goofy smile on my face. Now that smile was at the world, not at the fog.


5- That injury I had affected a bunch of parts on the left side of my body, and my circulation. When I'd get stressed, my heart would beat like crazy, the left side of my neck would tighten, sometimes the side of my stomach where the injury was would sting or hurt a little. It's a lot better than it was, but the healing has been so slow. I swear I feel like my healing has gone through the roof since quitting. My heart doesn't pump like crazy, I'm handling the stress better, my neck doesn't get tight, etc. I can't quite explain how, but I feel like my body has been settling back into what it was before. I went for a run yesterday, something that would get my injury to flair up everytime I'd do it before, and today I just feel... kinda sore all over. It's not centered on the injured parts, it's not stabbing pains, it's just normal soreness from working out.


6- The most important one, and the most simple. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have control over myself. My mind and body are one. I'm not just thinking maybe I'm strong enough, I KNOW it, and knowing it is a power I never had before. I'm not letting things happen and just smoking my problems away, I'm MAKING things happen. It's a power you're trading for addiction, and it can only come from the trade and nothing else. It comes from you and from you alone. That child I used to be, the child that we all have in us, I know now that he's smiling. I feel his tiny smile in my soul, his little hands pumping the air and rooting for me. I'm not doing this to get laid, I'm not doing this for my mom or my dad, I'm not even doing this for me. I'm doing this for that little boy who had so many more hopes for me. I'm doing this because HE deserves better from me, even when I feel like I don't deserve it. He does, and so does that child in you.

I'm sorry this is so long. I get carried away when I write things, and this was probably more for me than it is for you. I'm gonna save this so I can look at my own words later if I feel like falling off the wagon. If you do read this, all of this, every word, then I think you know that you need this too. You can get there. You can absolutely get there, just like I'm getting there, because at the end of the day...

This is your alcohol, and that is your beer. It's as simple as just not doing it",1,chanda_solo,0

The only real threat to others with prohibition is the violent mafias/cartels around it, same happened during the first drug (alcohol) prohibition.

mqqsa8i,"agony,hurt,nervous,pain,sleep",,marijuana,"Dear OP,

i¬¥m very happy to have found your comment and would like to continues the conversation.

I am in my mid 30s and long time consumer (i had pauses but always come back to it)

The last several Months i¬¥ve been increasing my consumption since weed got legal in my country and i grow my own stash.

Listen... the last weeks have been horrible for me, i experienced lots of cramps & pain in my legs and feet especially.

  
since i always had issues with my back / leg due to other reasons i always tend to stretch etc also.

since im not in the best psychological state too, i think i have overdone it... i took a ""blackroll"" for my fascies and i probably hurt myself during that.

  
i tend to get compulsive / obsessive with that, especially after having smoked.

  
now today i decided not to smoke, since i was just like u in agony, couldnt sleep at night etc.

I am still wondering if its a physical or psychological / nerver stuff.

  
but i also wanna rule out its due to my cannabis consume.

  
so today i just did not smoke (for some reason usally i can not ""just stop"" because i really want to just do it)...

the cramps have noticeably gone aways and not yet came back. theres still lots of other stuff (because i had loud cracking in parts of my shoulder / spine that also helped to relief) that could have caused this, but i cant rule out its the weed.

So... well i dont know man i kinda feel happy to not be the only one asking if it might be in relation to cannabis.

I figured that Wim Hofs Breathing Method relieves me of my pain, so it might be connected to my nervous system, which might have been overactive due to cannabis

Im genuinely curious how are you doing today ?

  
ps: i also just wanna share as a side note:  i figured to have a Anterior pelvic tilt which definetly also leads to back pain and for some exercises that also helped with the pain.",1,chanda_solo,1

1l11w21,"agony,anxiety,anxious,dream,fear,hurt,pain,sleep,worry",,leaves,"Put off healing and taking responsibility for 12 years | Back in 2013 I was 18 and had my first love, we were together about 2 years and about 2 months after the break up was when I first started smoking daily.  The reason for her leaving me was that she was moving out of state to continue college (I was a little younger, still in final year of high school) and didn't think she would be able to balance a long-distance relationship with the intense workload she was about to bear.  Looking back she was right in her decision and it wouldn't have ever worked out, but I was so hurt I said some terrible things and handled the entire situation horribly.  This reaction caused me to also lose her as a friend. 

Smoking weed made the pain go away, but nothing came back in its place.  I went to college for a semester soon after before dropping because I would wake and bake every morning and inevitably end up not going to class as a result.  It fucked my social skills up even worse than they already were and not only did I not meet any new romantic interests, I didn't even really make any friends during my time there.  After this point I just started staying home all day, getting stoned and watching Daria (every time I would reach the finale, I would desperately wish I had handled getting broken up with as well as Tom did) and doing absolutely nothing productive.  I stopped caring as much about my hygiene and only showered or brushed my teeth a couple of times a week.  

I attempted to make a change in 2015 by moving with my best friend to a college town an hour or two away from our hometown when he went to attend a university, but I made no attempt to change anything and still kept smoking.  I didn't know anyone in the town that sold and I didn't have the social skills to find a dealer, so I would spend 3 hours AT LEAST twice a week driving to and back from my hometown to buy, and otherwise lived exactly the same in this new environment as I did before the move.  My best friend and I ended up having a falling out a year later in large part due to how much he hated seeing me live how I had been living, and because of how aggressive and generally mentally unstable I had become.  I was miserable and a shell of who I was.

I lived by myself in that town until 2020, when I ended up getting evicted due to how disgusting and squalid I had let the apartment I was in get.  The landlord gave me multiple chances to clean up and even made a gesture of support by giving me a bible (Alabama, I'm not religious but the thought was still nice) but ended up having to process the eviction.  My downstairs neighbor was having leaking issues from a pipe between our units, and the trash was built up so high and thick that the maintenance workers couldn't get in or out of the unit, and if I had been given any longer the damage to his unit likely would have been even worse.  The damage I had done to my own apartment was so bad that my grandmother, who acted as a guarantor for me since I had (and still have) no credit, ended up getting sued.

After this point, I spent a couple of years living out of hotels while trying to find a new place to live.  This was the beginning of the pandemic, and things were admittedly hard for everyone at that point, but I still made no effort to change or grow.  I ended up staying at a Quality Inn in southern Illinois for a while as the state had recently just legalized weed and my last connect in the Alabama town had dried up, and while there I continued to smoke weed and do nothing.  Probably the most interesting thing that happened to me in the period was my car getting shot while sitting in the parking lot.  I also ended up getting stuck in the Mississippi Gulf Coast at one point due to getting a flat tire.  If I had just spent money on the tire immediately, there would have been no issue, but any cent I got was going to Delta 8 and Doordashing fast food.  I was there for 2 months, only intended to stay about a week.

This entire time, I should add, ALL of my money was being given to me by my Dad.  The only job I've ever worked was 2 weeks at a Burger King in 2016, and I quit because, of course, I got stoned in the morning and decided I didn't want to go.  My dad is not rich and was going broke trying to pay for all of my hotel fees, food, and weed expenses.  My grandmother was also incredibly worried about me.

I became really anti social at a point, outright refusing to interact with people in any non-business related scenarios.  I remember one time a girl was trying to be nice and compliment me on my leopard-print shirt at a gas station, and my word-for-word response was ""I don't want to have a conversation.""  There are a countless number of interactions I've had over the years where I've been really shitty to people that weren't being shitty to me or even actively trying to be friendly and get to know me, for no other reason that I was bitter.

In 2022, I finally ended up moving back in with my Dad in my hometown after the hotels became too much and having still not found a new apartment.  I've been here ever since, continuing to live the same, taking poor care of the house and myself as I spend all day smoking THCA weed and staring at screens.  For over two years I'm pretty sure the only places I ever walked inside of were smoke shops and gas stations, otherwise I was at home.  I started fully self-isolating at this point, not even talking with my Mom (who lives half an hour away) for years for no real reason.  My old best friend started trying to get into contact with me, I ignored him.  Another close friend, a girl I was close with since we were both teens, who I had feelings for and who I might have had a chance with had I actually attempted pursuing her, also tried to get into contact with me, and I ignored her.  My own half-brother, who graduated high school a year ago, I haven't talked to since he was around 15.  I even tended to have very short conversations with my Dad himself, despite living in the same house with him (it's not a large house, either).

About a week ago I was casually scrolling through Instagram, and an account popped up in my ""Suggested for You"" section.  I unconsciously read the name, and then looked at the profile pic.  It was my ex from 12 years ago.  I hadn't thought hard about her or the situation in so long.  I genuinely felt my heart drop.  She's aged remarkably well.  She's a science teacher, she's working on a graduate degree in astronomy at one of the most well-respected Aerospace schools in the US, and she's a mother.  While I've been sitting around, ugly and angry and gross and depressed, she's done so much with her life.  SO much time has passed.  It felt like waking up from a coma.  I was ashamed, for the first time in 12 years, TRULY ashamed of how I've been living.  She healed, and I could've if I had allowed myself, but now the wound was ripped right back open and I felt intense guilt like I haven't felt since 2013.  She would be ashamed to know how I've turned out, she believed in me more than anyone I've ever met.  I had plans back then to become an English teacher.  I haven't even thought of THAT in years.  I had plans to pursue game design, music, writing, animation, all skills that I haven't worked to cultivate at all in the time since.  I've spent over a decade of my life lost in a thick, intense fog, and seeing her cleared a small patch up, just enough for me to really see myself.

It's like when a bone heals incorrectly, and the surgeons have to break it again so it can be set and heal properly.  I've spent 12 years using weed to patch up the pain instead of actually feeling it and doing something with my life.  Now it's time I allowed myself to heal properly, time to feel EVERYTHING, all the anxiety, all the sorrow, all the grief.  I'm not getting those 12 years back.  I'm 30 now.  My 20s are gone and I have nothing to show for it.  But 30 is better than 31.  I have to stop feeling sorry for myself.  I have to forgive myself.  I have to be what she saw in me, what I saw in myself before I let fear of heartache take it all away.

I've attempted to quit weed a couple of times in the past.  Once for about 2 months in 2019, when I was planning a visit to Chicago that ended up falling through.  Another period, also 2 months, was when I first moved back in with my Dad a couple years ago.  Every attempt has obviously failed.  I would not intend to quit long term, taking more of a ""tolerance break"".  I would only attempt to quit after smoking up everything I had, often including the resin caked up inside the bowl (I never actually go through the effort of cleaning my pipe, of course).  I would get drunk to try and deal with the cravings.  And worst and most importantly of all, I replaced my time with nothing.  I would sit on the internet all day, still not talking to anyone, still not going anywhere, still not doing anything.  I wouldn't tackle the actual issues going on in my head, I would just try to ""simulate"" the disconnect I would get from weed with other methods.

But this time feels different.  This time IS different.  I had like 5 grams left, I FLUSHED it all.  I've NEVER flushed weed before, I've thought about it in the past but never had the heart or balls.  I wanted it AWAY from me.  I threw my pipe, grinder, papers, tray, and all other paraphernalia away too.  I'm not drinking, and barely even consuming caffeine.  WAY more water.  I've been using Soylent and mashed potatoes to deal with the appetite repression.  I've been going on walks around my neighborhood every single day around noon, getting sun, getting exercise, seeing people and actively trying to wave at them and being kinda happy when they wave back.  I've reconnected with everyone I can.  I hung out with my Mom yesterday, we got some BBQ and went to an antique shop and drove around a state park looking at campgrounds so we can go camping later this Summer, it was so fucking pleasant and cathartic.  She forgave me for not talking in so long.  I've talked to my little brother again, and we're hanging out in 3 days.  I'm visiting my old best friend in Nashville on Friday.  I'm visiting that other close friend I had feelings for in a couple of weeks, we've been emailing each other and it's been amazing catching up.  

It's only been a week, but things are looking so much brighter now.  I feel so much better, I've been crying a LOT but it's honestly been so good to feel something again.  The feeling in my chest is its own sort of ""body high"", I feel tension leaving my body that's been there for as long as I can remember.  I'm breathing so much better, coughing up so much less phlegm, I have so much fucking ENERGY, my brain can keep track of every thought I have.  I can shower and brush my teeth everyday without even thinking about it.  I'm never smoking weed again.  I appreciate what it's done for me, but I should've accepted long ago that I'm not someone that can be remotely functional while under its influence.  I'm not the competent stoner that writes music and makes art and gets shit done, and that's okay.  I can be a competent sober guy that writes music and makes art and gets shit done.  I can pursue my dreams, I can see all the places I've always wanted to see, I can go back to college, I can establish connections and make friends, I can fall in love again.  I can take responsibility.  I can, and I WILL, be a better person and start living the life I deserve.

To everyone on this sub that wants to quit but feels they can't, that feels it's been too long and the agony  is too severe, you can do it.  I don't know what you're hiding from in the fog, but it's still there.  It'll find you no matter how hard you try to stay out of sight.  You have to clear the fog and face it head-on, otherwise it will always be a threat, and you'll always be fearful.  You deserve to be seen, to see yourself, and to see what's standing 5 feet in front of you.  You're stronger than you realize, but you have to put yourself in the fight.  You have to let yourself heal, the weed is just a bandage.  A better version of you is waiting.

I apologize for the massive wall of text.  During the isolation I imposed upon myself, another form of disconnect I experienced was an inability to post online.  The weed made me so paranoid and anxious that I couldn't even take part in basic Reddit/Discord discussions on things like video games, because putting myself out there in any capacity had become incredibly upsetting.  Me making this post is another step in the right direction, I don't even feel hesitant.  Anyone that's taken the time to read this is helping me to heal and maintain sobriety, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for that.  I hope I've helped at least some of you, too.

One final thing, I read a Robert Frost poem on my first day of sobriety.  It made me tear up hard and I've been rereading it once or twice a day since.  I want to share it.

dark and deep.  
But I have promises to keep,  
And miles to go before I sleep,

1kw5pgj,"afraid,agony,anxiety,dream,pain",,leaves,"Autistic, CPTSD, BPD, anxious and quitting | Been smoking weed for 18 years. Being high helped me muffle painful emotions living as an autistic person with CPTSD, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. Being high helped reduce the effects of the constant flashbacks of a painful childhood and resulting shame-filled present. 

Helped with the feeling of rejection from being unable to assimilate with neurotypical society. Helped me cope with being poor, being unable to afford medical care or food or housing. $60 on a bag akways seemed a better investment than crying and raging daily over each new pain resulting from some human interaction or the system at large. It helped me shove my feelings down and keep the tears at bay so I could clock in or keep grinding some other way to improve my life. 

Being deeply empathetic and autistic has led to many bouts of burnout (I'm actually in one now for the last 10 years at this point), and being high helped me stay literally alive. I've never attempted suicide while high, I'll put it that way.

But exactly one year ago, as I turned to smoke my first bowl of the day, I was repulsed by the ash on my rolling tray and the smell in the air and the sticky pipe. Suddenly, I decided I was done smoking flower, and I would vape instead. The feeling came from absolutely nowhere, with no prior thought to this decision. 

I was making no decision about being stoned anymore, it was simply a smell issue. So here I am, 12 months later, still very much enjoying vapes. 

But these past couple of weeks I've been thinking about the fact that I seem to be succeeding in shedding the things that used to cause me so much shame, and therefore, perhaps I don't need this THC crutch anymore to dull the agony. Maybe I have the resources in me to deal with issues as they come up. 

I'm about to move into my dream home in a few days, something I accomplished by myself despite my homelessness and my fuckedupness. I stopped tolerating anyone who attempts to violate my autonomy, especially excluding abusive romantic partners from my life. I'm accomplishing majorly loving things for myself, and I feel myself healing. So maybe, after those first brutal three or six months of sobriety, I can tolerate the world without THC?

But I'm terrified of having a meltdown that will result in another round of shame/depression leading to self injury, as I have a long history of it. I'm afraid of leaving THC behind and exposing myself to sharper agony.

I could continue to seclude in my bedroom and watch documentaries on psychology and interviews with therapists as I've been doing solidly for the past 10 years, but along with keeping myself secure and safe, it also will lead to continued avoidance of meaningful relationships and exposure to new passions. I guess I'm afraid of feeling good and bad. I know, I'm not alone in this. 

I see other people getting sober and keep thinking, ""Yeah, but this person doesn't have constant flashbacks of being assaulted or abused, or constant new realizations of abuse that I hadn't understood until recently, barely surviving a swirl of rejection and shame from the world at large."" But I know there must be others out there like me, willing to climb more mountains to save myself.

I hope I've made myself clear. I'm just saying what I feel and think in an attempt to meet like-minded people for some encouragement. I move into my new house on Saturday. I would love for this to be my last vape. But doing everything alone is so tiresome.",1,chanda_solo,1
jl3ah5c,"always tired,anxiety,anxious,sleep,stress",,mmj,"Are you ADHD? I am, and was misdiagnosed for about a decade. ADHD patients are often anxious and depressed due to their symptoms. *Most* people have the opposite experiences with indicas than you. They are known as the typical downers, and sativas as the uppers, due to the most common terpene profiles among the most common strains. But there are almost countless factors that affect the terpene profile of an individual plant, like lineage, how it is grown, how it is dried, how it is cured, if it was a exposed to contaminates, etc.

This is why learning your personal terpene profile is an excellent way to learn to medicate with cannabis. Saying a strain is a ‚Äúsativa‚Äù or ‚Äúindica‚Äù is a figure of speech 99.99% of the time at a dispo. Nearly everything sold legally is technically a hybrid now, and all states with any legalization require testing at dispos *for each harvest*, and require those test results be available at those same dispos. You can always request it, even though many budtenders aren‚Äôt even aware of the existence of terpenes. They will usually offer a percentage when you ask, but you can legally request the specific, *exact* terpene test results for *that specific harvest,* which is very important when medicating. 

ADHD patients have a dopamine deficiency which causes us to seek out novel stimulation in new activities, which is often expressed as a low attention span. This is can be mentally taxing, which can lead to fatigue. So indicas, which are known to relieve stress by causing a sleepy, body high, actually stress me out.  I‚Äôm always tired. I need something to *pep me up,* because my anxiety and depression are often linked with a feeling of exhaustion. 

This is why amphetamines are a common medication for us. Many people get *more* anxious when they are that amped up, but it relieves anxiety in ADHD patients, because it gives our brains the dopamine it craves, which actually levels us out instead of making us erratic. I wake up erratic, and even out as my meds kick in. Most people are the opposite, hence my condition being dubbed a ‚Äúmental illness.‚Äù",1,chanda_solo,0

m4glyus,"bedtime,dream,insomnia,sleep",,petioles,"# How Cannabis Use Affects Sleep

Cannabis, especially products high in THC, can significantly impact sleep quality by suppressing **REM sleep**, the stage associated with dreaming, memory processing, and emotional health. Here‚Äôs an overview of how cannabis affects sleep, the consequences of altering usage patterns, and strategies to maintain healthy sleep habits.

# Effects of Regular Cannabis Use on Sleep

* **REM Sleep Suppression**: THC reduces the amount of time spent in REM sleep, leading to fewer dreams. This suppression can interfere with the brain‚Äôs ability to process emotions and consolidate memories.
* **Feeling Less Refreshed**: Despite getting sufficient hours of sleep, the lack of REM can result in waking up feeling less restored over time.

# What Happens When You Quit or Reduce Use

1. **REM Rebound**: When you quit cannabis, the brain compensates for prior REM suppression by entering REM sleep more frequently or intensely, known as REM rebound. This can lead to vivid or unusual dreams.
2. **Withdrawal and Insomnia**: Quitting cannabis may temporarily cause insomnia or difficulty staying asleep as the body readjusts.

# Reducing Use to Weekends Only

* **REM Sleep Recovery on Off Days**: The body may recover REM sleep during non-use days; however, the extent of recovery depends on usage frequency and intensity.
* **Inconsistent Sleep Patterns**: Alternating between cannabis-influenced sleep (with suppressed REM) and natural sleep (with REM recovery) can disrupt the overall balance of sleep cycles.

# Strategies to Improve Sleep

To balance occasional cannabis use with good sleep quality:

1. **Spacing Out Consumption**: The more days you abstain, the more consistent your sleep patterns will be.
2. **Smaller Doses**: Using smaller amounts of cannabis might minimize its impact on REM sleep.
3. **Healthy Sleep Hygiene**: Maintain a consistent bedtime, avoid screens before bed, and create a relaxing evening routine.

Take ten deep, slow breaths when you feel stressed.

CBD's anxiolytic, anti-anxiety, properties have been recorded in medcal literature going back to the early 1980s.

There are NO recorded instances of dependence or addiction to CBD or CBG, or tolerence shifts with patients who use CBG for pain management.

THC gets you high, and it can cause and exacerbate inflammation..

Give an exhale and take ten deep, slow breaths any time you feel stressed, and count the breaths.

Counting requires attention and is very basic math, adding one to the previous number, so this gets your higher brain functions operating.

Deep breathing brings lots if oxygen into the body.

Stress is maintained as a physical process by stress hormones, primarily cortisol, which are broken down by oxygen.

Deep breathing effects the Vagus nerve to slow the heart rate, and it directs the HPA axis (essentailly mood control) to reduce activity in the amygdala (fear/emotional reaction center) and increase activity in the hippocampus (memory writing/recall center) so that you are less reactive and more rational.

Exhale, first.

Trying to take a deep breath while your lungs are full of air, as from hyperventilating, can make you feel like you can't breathe which will just add to stress, so give an exhale, first, so that your lungs are ready for a big breath.

Take ten deep, slow breaths when you feel stressed to help you relax.",1,chanda_solo,1

The joint wasn't too bad surprisingly, taste was shit, but it was actually pretty smooth and the experience or smoking a J felt nice. The bong rips on the other hand were more harsh somehow, and just magnified the shit flavor. I couldn't get past one small bowl with that one, just not fun at all. 

The big thing I noticed, is because I wear a Fitbit it tells me my oxygen levels while I sleep. As well as heart rate, breathing rate, etc. The days I smoked my oxygen was a couple percent lower at night, my heart rate 15bpm above average for the day, and all the other numbers were slightly worse. My lungs felt bad, gave me a bad cough that I felt in my lungs and could tell was fucking with my ability to take a full breath like normal. I'm 30 now, so this never was an issue when I was 20. Lesson learned. 

Went back to vaping my flowerpot, and after 3 days of healing up my lungs from smoking, I felt normal again. All my health stats went right back to being where they should be. I can breathe great and my oxygen is up, etc. And when the vapor gets harsh and makes me cough, it's only in my throat and never feel it in my lungs. Never makes me feel like I can't breathe fully.

I don't like to smoke at all (apart from cigs), but I do want to like it, because it seems to help others, and I also just want to ""understand"" the hype. Every time someone offers me a joint, I think: ""maybe this time I will like it!"", and I, of course, never do.

-Dizziness 

-Nausea 

-Burning in throat

-I lose my balance

-My body feels heavy, and I have a hard time walking upright 

-My heart beats faster, and it feels like I have something heavy on my chest, heavy breathing

-Paranoia

-Visual and auditory hallucinations

I thought it made me confident. That it made me calm. That it gave me some kind of edge over the rest of the world.

But what it was really doing? It was eating me alive from the inside.

The Symptoms I Ignored for Years

It started small‚Äîthings I could brush off. A little anxiety here, a bit of tiredness there. But then came the real symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	That racing heartbeat at night when everything was supposed to be quiet.
	‚Ä¢	That feeling of dissociating from reality, like I was just floating through life without actually being present.
	‚Ä¢	Those heart attack-like symptoms that sent me into panic mode. Chest tightness. Shortness of breath.
	‚Ä¢	That constant fear of dying, even though doctors kept saying I was fine.
	‚Ä¢	The inability to fully enjoy life, because something always felt off.

And yet, I couldn‚Äôt quit. For years.

The Addiction That Disguises Itself as a Lifestyle

For 2-3 years, I kept telling myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll quit tomorrow.‚Äù But tomorrow never came.

Because deep down, I was convinced:
	‚Ä¢	Weed makes me creative.
	‚Ä¢	Weed makes me social.
	‚Ä¢	Weed makes me confident.
	‚Ä¢	Weed is my secret superpower.

But here‚Äôs the truth: Weed was the thing holding me back the most.

It was stopping me from living to my full potential. It was the invisible chain wrapped around my life, keeping me trapped in a loop.

I wasn‚Äôt becoming better. I was just becoming dependent.

Quitting Wasn‚Äôt Easy, But It Was Worth It

The hardest part wasn‚Äôt the withdrawals.
It wasn‚Äôt the cravings.
It wasn‚Äôt even the anxiety.

The hardest part was convincing myself that life without weed was actually better.

Because weed tricks you. It makes you believe it‚Äôs helping you when it‚Äôs actually destroying you.

And the worst part? Nobody talks about it.

If You‚Äôre Struggling, Listen to Me.

I know what it‚Äôs like to be trapped. I know what it‚Äôs like to think, ‚ÄúI can quit whenever I want.‚Äù I know what it‚Äôs like to feel like you need it to function.

But you don‚Äôt.
	‚Ä¢	Limit caffeine. Limit nicotine. These only fuel your anxiety.
	‚Ä¢	Talk to someone. Assurances help. You are not alone in this.
	‚Ä¢	Challenge your thoughts. Weed is not making you better‚Äîit‚Äôs making you dependent.
	‚Ä¢	Start small. Even one day without it is a win.

Your Life is Waiting For You. Don‚Äôt Waste It.

If you feel stuck, if you feel lost, if you feel like you need weed to be yourself‚Äîreach out. Talk. Discuss.

You are stronger than you think.

Here‚Äôs what I can tell you, increased paranoia when discontinuing use is not common and is not expected. Some people end up self-medicating anxiety and/paranoia via cannabis, and when they stop their mental health symptoms increase. This sounds like what you might be experiencing. 

I think it‚Äôs a good idea that you see a psychiatrist and a therapist, as soon as you can. There are some great medications for anxiety that aren‚Äôt habit forming like benzodiazepines. Anxiety to the point of paranoia is really uncomfortable and potentially destabilizing, so I would encourage you to try various methods to calm your mind. CBD softgels (I‚Äôd recommend 100mg-200mg) can help as they‚Äôre very relaxing at that dose, at night Benadryl can both help you sleep and it has an anxiolytic effect that can help the following morning, Insight Timer is an amazing free app for meditation (I recommend Tara Brach she is great with emotional discomfort), and the app ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Up?‚Äù is also a free app with a ton of helpful resources with no ads (Insight Timer is also ad free).

Day 1-2 was fine, some chills and cravings

Day 3-6 has been absolute hell, chills, sweats, bad headaches, basically just feeling like I have the flu but no fever so it can't be that, tons of congestion and constant coughing, I've been bed bound this whole time

Day 7 the congestion in my head is lifting today, still tons of congestion in my chest and now a wet sorta rattley cough hacking up tons of phlegm. But the sweats and chills are way worse now, rapidly going between the two from sweating till soaked then freezing. I truly don't know if this is withdrawals or if I caught something but the lack of a fever makes me think withdrawals.

Please tell me this gets better soon. I did this during the holidays and I'm about to be off pto on the 1st.

(Actually, I forgot I was in the sub and left and joined again within a week üòû)

Context: 34. been smoking on and off from my teens. Quit in summer 22, a while after my dad passed away as the anxiety, weight loss, etc. were just too much, there was no joy. (Probably about ¬Ωoz per week)

The withdrawals were hell. I lost further weight (was underweight to start), and the anxiety completely took over (health anxiety).
I remember the sweats, the nausea, the despair, the fear. Think it was around a fortnight before I started to feel better and I swore to myself, I swore to my loved ones, that was it, I was done, it was no longer serving me. 

Fast forward to  the start of this year, and BOOM, a pack of edibles won't hurt... I'll not be smoking, I thought. I'll be OK. Ha. So, several packs of edibles later, the smoking started again. At first, I was moderating, and I would reward myself with a smoke after completing tasks. Then I done wake and bake, and the rest is history.

Weight loss started again, and I got so anxious/paranoid about the quality of my flowers and the effect on my lungs that I decided to try my own edibles. Apparently, my tolerance is the highest it's ever  been. Smoking isn't getting me there, and neither are edibles. Here's the kicker, I went into withdrawal because I cut the smoking and had the worst 2 days of my life, and didn't even realise!

 Last night, I had a small smoke to break the sweats and vicious circle of anxiety that had me convinced it was my last day on earth, and the sweating stopped for about 15 minutes!!

Cue epiphany üôÑ I lay in bed anxious and sweaty again, nauseous and empty, reading this subreddit for a few hours, eternally grateful for the others posting their experiences and advice. It's horrifying to know that so many of you are suffering, I wish it were not that way, but there is a comfort in knowing you're not alone. 

Apologies for the longwinded post, probably nonsensical in parts, but the more I write, the more accountable I can hold myself. 

So, here goes. 

Day 1- Woke up drenched after already changing through the night. Anxiety lingers.
Avoided coffee, opted for vitamin infused green tea. No appetite, so I'm slowly sipping a meal replacement drink, debating if I should avoid the scales for a while, so I'm not seeing those numbers drop üòî

Quite emotional, one minute I'm, dare I say, OK, the next I'm raging out and then I'm crying.

Not much motivation. I just want the sweating to stop. Scared to exercise, I know it will help mentally, but physically, I can't keep up with the calories or protein in the immediate days.


EDIT for day 2:
I slept about 3 hours last night, and health anxiety was rife, exhaustion eventually won. I woke feeling relatively better! Today, I have not had as much anxiety, I'm working on staying hydrated, meditating through the worst moments of the day and trying to make my food intake count for something (high nutritional content over anything), but the nausea is still preventing me from eating much. Don't know where I'd be without the amazing support of my husband. Soul searching hit hard today. A lot of self realisation, guilt, shame, and regret. BUT with those who also came quality movie time with my family, a break from all symptoms but the sweaty palms. I felt... happiness today, for the first time in longer than I care to remember, I have happy tears tonight. 

As an aside, I'll mention I have had zero cravings at any time since deciding, my weary brain knows better. 


EDIT for Day 3.

Health anxiety still there, but manageable.
Slept longer last night, but again woke up several times drenched in sweat. I think I'm having dreams again, but not quite remembering them (Probably not a bad thing!) 
I managed to eat a few light snacks today, feeling nauseous after several bites and sometimes wretching.
My legs are so achy, flu-like almost. I guess it's a culmination of lack of proper diet, exhaustion and tension. 

A positive of today and actually now just realised while typing, is also probably a contributing factor to the exhaustion is I haven't had any coffee today at all as the thought of it is turning me! So I've went from coffee with sugar probably 8-10 cups a day to nothing in a matter of 3 days... gotta take the little wins!


Edit for day 4
I'm writing this on day 5 and brain fog is at a maximum so will probably miss some, but it was a better day. I managed more sleep and less sweating, dreamed I was in a meadow (grateful it wasn't sinister) first dream of the year.
Managed ¬º of a sandwich and a toddler sized dinner before wretching both times. Cried randomly. Felt shame, guilt, remorse, embarrassment, all the things I know I need to feel and process, grateful for not being stoic. Grateful for being able to be emotionally available to my family 
Felt motivated to go to the garden and do some weeding, pulled up potatoes with my husband and daughter and had the biggest dopamine dump ‚ô•Ô∏è there's a lot to be said for getting your hands in the earth in terms of mental health.

Day 5:
Woke after an OK sleep feeling ready to take on the day and was quickly crushed by health anxiety and a return of the sweats in force. I find myself forgetting really simple things (ie well known character names) whilst remembering nightmares I had as a 5 year old. 
I practiced stretches and meditation in my garden, they help wonderfully in the moment, but it's difficult to maintain equilibrium with a busy and overstimulating household on top of all the shit in my head. Muscle fatigue is a big factor today. Zero cravings. Today has been a mix of anxiety, sadness and irritability, but there has been comfort and solace in time spent with my family, I'm so grateful for them. 
Sharing experiences with other leavers and (hopefully) helping others where I can with my own story, is really benefiting my mental health. Here's to another day sober. 


Day 6
Anxiety still lingers, but manageable with deep breathing/meditation/ reassurance from husband. What also helped is asking questions on this sub, making me feel a lot more normal and not alone. Had the motivation to exercise today, but not yet the energy, if that makes sense. Done a few sessions of tai chi instead of intensive exercise and it really helped loosen my muscles and bring anxiety levels down to bearable (one of my kids joined in half way and it was so enjoyable!). Going to bed tired tonight, fingers crossed for a better sleep. Noisy gut present, a few pains here and there but appetite is on the up, so I'm expecting there to be a little digestive upset. 

Day 7-ONE WEEK!! Feeling proud. First half of today:

Anxiety doesn't want to leave me alone so I'm just accepting things as they are for now. I'm not dead, and I didn't die the last time I quit either. I've had clear blood tests in the last month so I'm keeping that in my head too. 
Heart rate is way up today. I know it's part of it from reading here and also from past experience, trying to practice deep breathing every time I feel it's too fast. RHR has jumped about 20bpm, have noticed I'm more on edge after caffeine so have gave it up again (I was on 10+ cups coffee a day then zero on day 1 of quitting weed) it seems any more than a half cup and I'm jittery. The more days pass, the more I can recognise the symptoms that are related to withdrawal and am thankful for the advice on reddit to manage these. I went shopping today, the fresh air was nice, and I raced my daughter down the street on the way back, after advice on another post about getting that heart rate up to quell the anxiety, and it worked üí™ bonus that I had a reason for an increase in heart rate aswell. Writing this all helps to process things, another way manage and I would recommend journalling to those of you who's head seems full of fuzz. 

Day 7, PM. I had an appetite last night and thought I'd seize the opportunity for extra calories, but I ate too late, heart rate was up and I felt very aware of it. Struggled to get to sleep and woke 3 times gasping for air in a panic, 2nd half of the night was better. 

Day 8
Exhausted, groggy and anxious due to lingering effects of last night's poor sleep. Going for a walk to get the circulation going and get some fresh air. 
Heart rate still increased, hoping these symptoms relieve themselves sooner than later, it's very depressing.
PM accepted that I may have more panic attacks and after 3 minor nocturnal ones I slept well. 

Day 9 and feeling fine! Appetite is üëç heart rate is still elevated, a few palpitations here and there, manageable. Considering starting C25k again, this time last year I was running 5km a few times a week just for the craic, I'm aiming to be there again by Halloween. I think my updates will be fewer and farther between. 

Quitting was the best decision I've made, not just for myself, but for the people I care about! I'll never look back, not going that way.",1,chanda_solo,1
k3twkc8,"fear,freaking out,pain,panic,scared,sleep",,saplings,"I'm a 15 year old male with a body weight around 120lbs. This was last night, but it's still very hazy. I remember taking two hits off a dab pen and after I took the hits I used that bathroom and got some water. I hadn't eaten much over the last few days. I went to my room and sat down in my chair already feeling the affects. At first it was going very well, until I felt the need to pop my finger in doing so I pushed my finger too hard without feeling the pain right away. I got this sense of a terrifying beating rhythm and started seeing visions of fire, I'm guessing it was the feeling of the pain coming after the fact due to a delay with the weed. This beating rhythm scared me and started a weed induced panic attack, I don't know if this would be considered greening out but it was a feeling of terror and fear that is unmatched by any simple throw up green outs I've had in the pased. This feeling was much worse and I was forgetting who I was.

With this feeling came extreme nausea and a loud ringing in my ears which I'm still having while writing this probably because it could still be in my system. The main thing is I started freaking the fuck out I texted my mom to tell her that the weed was having a really bad effect and that I felt like I was going to die. She came in my room and just the presence of her in my room helped so much. I started getting this feeling in my legs as if they were becoming static and would not move. They began to violently shake. As this was happening the most scary part happened my mom had left my room for no longer than 2 minutes but it felt like and hour of me imagining my heart beating rapidly it put me in a worse sense of terror and I almost let myself believe that it was never going to stop unless I died. I quickly got myself off that topic and back on my breathing. my mom had work in the morning and it was about 10p.m. I was trying to use the weed to sleep. 

My mom got me something to throw up in if necessary and she let me sleep on the floor of her room. I asked her to put on a fairly calm show that would keep my attention on so I wouldn't start thinking that I was going to have a heart attack. I tried to lay down but couldn't get comfy until I found a spot that started to feel decent. I started dosing off a bit. When I closed my eyes I had very clear visions and when I opened my eyes I got scared again. I woke up my mom and she told me to just repeat to myself that ""I was okay and that I was safe"". I layed back down and started repeating that in my head. As I dosed off again I kept waking back up slightly more tired each time and when I woke up I would get scared again over and over but it was less bad each time. Still repeating that I was okay and safe I fell asleep. I woke up 2 hours late at about 12:30a.m and I forgot what I had been telling myself which really seemed to freak me out. As I started panicking again I relentlessly tried to figure out what I had been telling myself since it was all that had helped me. I kept freaking out until I finally figured out what it was. So I started repeating it again and I fell asleep for 13 hours and I was pretty much okay. The only really bad part after that experience is I have a sense of really wanting to know what everything means and I have been in a very ""smart"" mood all day. Which my mom said I've been speaking in a more intelligent way today and what I've been saying has made more sense. I still have the slight feeling that things are fake and when the ringing in my ears starts again I start to get fearful again. I don't think it will last too much longer, I think the weed just needs to fully leave my system.

That was my experience I hope it helps I know it's been 5 years since the question was asked but if this helps someone else not feel alone or feel better about the situation that's great. I still don't know if it was a ""green out"" or if I was just having a panic attack. I'm staying away from weed for a while especially that dab pen.",1,chanda_solo,1

1g9a0p5,"anxiety,anxious,fear,feels like I'm dying,panic,worry",,petioles,"I get anxious almost every time I get high, what should I do? | Just came across this sub for the first time. Sorry for long post. TLDR; tips on mitigating anxiety and weed? Any kinds of THC that I should be looking for more (delta 8, 10, etc)? CBD? I understand quitting would help but the times I get high and I'm not anxious or I'm able to move past it, I still really enjoy it, so looking for advice on how (or if) I still can.

I consider myself a fairly regular user, not every day but a few times a week at most. I try not to get high for multiple days in a row, and sometimes I'll go like a week before getting high again. An issue that's come up kinda recently though is that I have been getting really anxious while high, and even when I'm sober. It's worse when I take edibles so I've been smoking more, but I still get anxious smoking. I've dealt with a lot of mental health issues in my life but anxiety was honestly never at the forefront, it was there for sure but not as bad as most people I know.

But this summer I have had multiple high panic attacks, some while sober, and just generally feeling a LOT more anxiety. I got prescribed anxiety meds for the first time and it definitely helps my day to day, but when I get high it's a lot harder to cope. Almost every time I get high, I feel anxious that I've smoked too much, or took too much of an edible, and that I'm going to randomly faint (which happens when I'm high OR sober, moreso when I'm high, it's been a problem my whole life and idk what specifically causes it, yes I plan on seeing a doctor about it). The fear of fainting is honestly the biggest thing. It has been terrifying and awful every time, sometimes feels like I'm dying for an extended period of time. And I especially don't want to faint in front of people cause I am socially anxious, lol. I often use in social settings (where it's appropriate) like parties or raves or live shows, because alcohol tends to make me feel too sick to feel worth it.

I will take literally any suggestions on what I can do to mitigate this, I consider myself a pretty new user (started using consistently only like a year and a half ago) so I feel like there is a lot left for me to learn about this stuff. I have so much respect for people who are in the process of quitting/have quit, but I don't think I want to do that just yet. It's pretty much the only substance I use, especially socially, and I still can and do have a great time with it if I can just figure out the anxiety thing. I do have a fairly okay relationship with it, I feel like I have finally gotten out of my dependency on it more or less...Still working on it but DEFINITELY an improvement these last few months, and it gets easier as times goes on. I'm at least not using multiple times a day anymore, and not getting as high. Maybe this all sounds like massive coping though and I should definitely quit, for mental AND physical health. I'm worried that I've already messed myself up a bit with the amount I've smoked and being under 25, and that it's the reason why I suddenly have such bad anxiety. I know people have done waay more and earlier but I'm just a bit paranoid about it. Any advice or even just general thoughts and shared experiences would be super appreciated. Thanks for reading if you did. :)

edit: ok yeah I know I know I could just stop. That is a fair suggestion and I guess also what I asked about so should have expected. But like. I still enjoy being high sometimes. It is still fun when I am not anxious. Clearly looking for a little more than ""just stop"". In hindsight I know this seems like a dumb post but I wish people treated this with a bit more nuance or friendliness, I thought this was a support sub.

Ive even developed anxiety of leaving my house, especially at night. And I'm not sure how to fix this, it feels like I'm dying when I leave, and smoking weed and staying in my bed was a sad but comforting way to escape this fear (this fear that caused itself).  
Reading is also a very safe and comforting thing Ive picked up again (I couldn't ever read when high) and it feels 100 times better than smoking.

2pw1gg,"flare-up,pain,sleep",,eldertrees,"I dosed ambien last night and all it did was convince me that medical marijuana should be universal. | Hi, all. I'm a marijuana enthusiast. I have been for almost 4 years now. It started out purely recreational, then about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune issue. Randomly one of my joints will just kill me. For example, This summer I had a flare-up in my hip and could barely step off the bus. MJ helps with the pain when I'm having a flareup, but I still smoke more-or-less every day. 

I've been dankrupt and I had a friday night alone so I figured ""why not try ambien?"" I've done other pills recreationally before (ativan, vicodin, buspar, adderall) so why not? 

Being a RESPONSIBLE drug user, I did my research using wikipedia and erowid. I set my room, texted a friend to check in with me, and then took 2-10mg tablets. 

Nothing. Mind you, erowid made me think that at this dose is when I'd start seeing weird shit and riding an ""ambien walrus""

30 minutes later I take a third one. I can't focus too well, but I'm still completely lucid. I had a tall boy of Rolling Rock in the fridge so I also had that. 

NOTHING. 

Around T+4:00 I just went to sleep. 

Now, ambien DOES effect my aunt. When she took it a few days ago, she was so impaired. :/ She could barely talk and thought I was yelling at her over the phone and didn't know what day it was. It was crazy. She uses ambien for pain and sleep. 

If she'd just have a little weed with me, I know she wouldn't need a lot to put her out and ease her pain. She also wouldn't be as impaired and loopy. I live with her and the number of times she's been wandering around the house off her ass on some big pharma crap...it scares me. I put on my ""it's all okay voice"" and send her to bed. Also when she comes home from work and talks about her pain all I wanna do is come out about my marijuana use. Unfortunately, she's totally against it. Outdated beliefs and all :/

IIRC THCA is converted to THC by heat, so a higher heat would cause more conversion.

My mind was immediately destroyed and from then on MMJ was working for me again  So, this just means ""take more THC"" right?  Well, hear me out.

I spent a lot of time switching up strains from there on and I regained my sensitivity to ""normal"" amounts of THC.  My original products that I might have overused still don't have the same effectiveness (with the same heat and amount consumed), but my new strains with similar THC content DO affect me.

That's my story, and I'm working on the theory of

1. For prevention: change up strains and intake methods (ie: vape vs edible methods)
2. A ""strong"" or particularly effective dose might ""knock out"" or ""reboot"" something in your system, and the the MMJ will work again
3. look for triggers when MMJ stops working (are you more stressed, congested, sick, not sleeping, allergies).  Are you inhaling / consuming in the same way as before?  Edit: am I taking it at the same time of day, with or without food in my system?

Right this second I'm experimenting with ways to deal with item 2), such as:

1. just take a lot more THC.  This will help you rest and you will rebuild your ability to get by on less THC.

Edit: Looking at the other suggestions, we have drinking water, taking a walk, using cbd, exercise.  All of these things have in common the fact that they are also typical advice for depression and mood problems.

Edit: all of these also shame the factor that they are ""self care.""  Maybe anything that is ""self care"" will work.  Self care in itself shifts one's mood.

What if functionally, the common thread here is the fact that they raise your baseline of mood / good brain chemicals in a way other than MMJ.

So what if you require a ""mood booster"" or something equivalent to what the other recommendations are.  What if a strong dose of the right strain of MMJ acts like a ""mood booster"" and kicks your body back into a cycle of ""boosted mood"" -> ""MMJ boosts mood"" -> boosted mood.  This is a theory I would like to prove.  I'm sure tolerance is a real thing but my experience with T-breaks and with some current issues don't add up to \*only\* tolerance being the thing.",0,chanda_solo,1

c2ikj31,"anxiety,fear,freaking out,pain,panic,paranoia,suffering,worry",,saplings,"Thank you so much for this amazing post.

Personally I started suffering from anxiety attacks a little after high school started, after I began to think deeply about death and my existence. The first time I had one I honestly thought I was having a heart attack and was going to die. The cycles of worry about what was happening to me increased my adrenaline levels and shortened my breath and made it worse, making me worry more. Of course at the time I didn't understand this at all. 

My attacks never happened too close together, sometimes even going years without having one, but when they came I was always sucked into the cycles of fear. I had no clue what was wrong with me during these episodes. One summer my attacks got really bad and I concluded that I had a heart condition. I'd feel a minor pain or tweak in my chest and that would start me off again thinking I was going to die, making the pain (real or imagined) worse. My incorrect self-diagnosis was actually making my attacks more frequent and painful.

Finally I figured out that I was having panic attacks, and after reading about the symptoms it all made sense. As it turns out, during that summer when my attacks got worse, the pains in my chest were mostly caused by gas building up in my stomach creating intense tightness in my chest. I had a terrible diet and didn't get much exercise, and these contributed to my problem.

Now I'm much more active and I know how to deal with the chest pains if they come. I usually just massage my back and stomach and it will release a lot of the pressure, I haven't had a panic attack sober in a long time and I definitely think smoking helped with that. The contrast between being high and sober really shows me how much control I have over my emotions when I'm sober. The most powerful thing is just the knowledge that you're only having a panic attack, which lets you break the cycle of fear. I can divert panic attacks now when I feel they're coming on just by recognizing the feeling and diverting my attention to something else.

When I get high I have a much more difficult time controlling my anxiety because my high mind overrides my common sense. It usually begins by thinking about my elevated heart rate which starts me on my fear cycles. Even though I intellectually know I'm just freaking out over nothing, it's almost impossible for me to just dismiss my feelings like I can while sober. All the suggestions you gave are some of the only things that help me out; drinking water, sitting down (or moving around if you have too much energy), and talking with friends or getting engrossed in something (tv, movie, music, games) to help you forget about your anxiety. I also used to get terrible paranoia because my friends and I would toke outdoors near a college campus which was teeming with police and campus security. Now that I smoke inside houses mostly that has helped tremendously with my paranoia (but knocks on the door still freak me out haha).

I also appreciate how in your post you point out how some people don't understand how you can get ""too high"", or they think you're simply a pussy or something because you don't want to smoke more. I would never want any of my friends to experience anxiety attacks like I have, but sometimes I wish they could understand what I'm feeling inside when I say I'm freaking out and I don't want to keep going. In the end it's just different tokes for different folks.

Thanks for reading this whole thing if you did. I went on far too long and it's mostly just me rambling, but it's good to get it off my chest. Maybe it will help someone who is going through similar problems. Been dry these past 3 months but very soon I'll be back in business. Much love to all my fellow ents out there. Be safe and have fun.

The first time I assumed I took too much and was like too high or something?  But the second time I had gone back down to a lower dose and it still happened.

NOW I'm thinking that the symptoms match low blood pressure.  Of course the internet says simultaneously that delta 9 can cause high and also low blood pressure, and read some experiences where either outcome is the case, thus the internet is unhelpful.  (Saw a hilarious meme that said something like, ""Why do I have to add +reddit to all my Google searches to find what I'm looking for?"")

My question to you marijuana geniuses is, is this a likely conclusion or does it sound like something else?  And assuming this is the problem, can I counteract it or should I just stop completely and never get high again?

Side-question:  What DOES being ""too high"" on delta 9 feel like?  Do you get physically sick or anything like that, or just really whacked out mentally?

I finally went on my first trip last night. My friend made the brownies, said there was 40g of weed in 250g of butter whatever that means. 3 people had it before I did and were totally fine.

I initially just had 1/3 of a brownie following my friends advice, but after an hour and a half I honestly wasn‚Äôt feeling anything and was getting a bit sad about it thinking I was one of those enzyme intolerant people, so I ended up now eating 3/4 of a brownie in total.

Just after the 2 hour mark hit, everything started very strong out of nowhere. I was just laying in bed and my body starting seizing up, jerking all over the place and I lost complete control over my mouth. Kept opening really wide slowly and then shifting into unnatural grinding positions. And it was like that for hours. But also during this I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between me being awake and dreaming. It was all so vivid, and as someone with Aphantasia and never having vivid dreams it was incredible. I felt so relaxed, happy and apparently was taking photos and videos that actually look and sound terrifying.

I‚Äôm also someone with chronic pain, I take opioid patches for it, and my pain was none. Absolute zero. I was sleeping like an angel, or at least it felt like despite what my body was doing throughout the night. Even now awake and back to normal I still feel so relaxed and euphoric after the trip. I was apparently texting my friends concerning messages but trust me when I say I was just doing amazingly.

Lastly, and this is TMI, but it made me extremely horny. On my antidepressant my libido is completely dead but this trip revived it super hard. So that was a pleasant surprise.

Now awake, I have a really bad taste in my throat I can‚Äôt get rid of even after brushing my teeth and mouthwash, a very mild headache and REALLY sore jaw. 8/10 would gladly do again. Any tips for the next trip is appreciated as I have 1 brownie left!",1,chanda_solo,1

Anyway, I""ll start at the beginning for a little context.

I smoked for the first time after high school at a music festival with some friends. I go so high I passed out in our tent for like 2 hours haha. Afterward I was pretty freaked out because it was still illegal at the time but, obviously, no one cared. Fast forward a few years of no use and I start going to college again after a year off to work. I meet some great guys to room with and things are going great until we all start smoking weed pretty heavy. I started smoking pretty much everyday all day, during classes, during shifts at work, etc. until I got to a point in my mental health where I couldn‚Äôt handle college anymore. Mind you there were other things that contributed to this more than just me being high all the time, but it didn‚Äôt help. 

After that mess, I took another year off to get clean and work, which goes well but I decide that a little weed isn‚Äôt going to hurt me and start smoking in the afternoons after work. I was still smoking quite a bit but not as much as I had been, which felt good but I was still smoking a lot. I was going through a stiiizy cart. In a like 3-4 days.

Then the pandemic hit and I went down a dark hole. I went right back to smoking 24/7, being high all the time every day because there wasn‚Äôt anything stopping me really, and things started to get bad. After a couple years of that level of smoking, my hair started to fall out in waves, my health started to decline and I wasn‚Äôt taking proper care of myself which had led to kidney stones and other health issues. My hair was what really kinda woke me up and I started deciding I needed to quit. Going from having great hair to looking like you‚Äôre turning into gollum is a bit of a wake up call. It was so bad I started using those hair loss products for men because I thought I was going bald (and they didnt really help) but now I am pretty sure my hair loss was a result of my smoking not genetics or hormones. 

So I decided to quit cold turkey and it was really rough. I was sweating so much I had to change shirts multiple times a day. Couldn‚Äôt really sleep or eat and when I did manage to sleep I‚Äôd always wake up after a couple of hours in a puddle of sweat. Headaches and nausea on top of that and I went back to using but with the goal of decreasing use. So I started off by using less potent product and then moving to decreasing frequency and I did really well. I got myself down to a couple of joints a day and was noticing that my hair was starting to grow back after only a couple of weeks into this change (further justifying to me that smoking was causing my issues with my hair more than anything). I was definitely excited and proud but also still struggling. 

I think I want to quit for a while, just until I notice my body getting back to normal and my hair grows back, but the withdraws are really killing me. I find that I am struggling between the decision to quit or to say fuck it and I guess I wanted to hear from others about their experiences. was it worth it to take a break/quit? Do you have a similar story to mine/experience any of the same things i have and how did you get through it? and any advice or kind words in general would be appreciated too. (Also sorry if the post is a little long)

CBN is a lot more sedating and help alot more with sleep then CBD does. 

I noticed once I added CBN into the mix my sleep drastically improved.

I take these CBN+CBD deep sleep gummies from herbal garden essentials and they also have L-theanine and melatonin in them. L-theanine switches the brain into a Theta brainwave State which is known for deep relaxation and meditative like state. Highly recommend these. I got them because they don't have THC in them which I want to Avoid because THC causes REM sleep interaction.

Also the key when taking cannabinoids is stacking them with other relaxing herbs and supplements. This will enhance the experience and effects.

e74kped,"migraine,pain,worry",,eldertrees,"I'm glad you've found a good balance. That wondering is not just you. That's actually another reason for my decision, and I may have oversimplified things for this post. I've always been very cautious about how any intoxicant may change me. I didn't take my first drink until several months after I turned 21. I also established rules for how often I could drink, which I have never broken.

I think part of the reason for my caution was having a family member who was a severe alcoholic (now recovered, thank God).

That same worry extends to cannabis now as well. I simply worry the me I could have chosen to be without it may have been better than the me I have chosen to be with it. I don't honestly believe that's true, and much of my use is medical - it's the only medication I've found which works on my severe migraines, which I've described as feeling like someone poured molten metal in my eye socket.

But after four years of daily use (with a few month-long breaks sprinkled in), I'm willing to go without for two months to see just how different I really am without it. I'm willing to endure the pain of my migraines with nothing but Excedrin to help me during that short time to find out. Just as I did for nearly thirty years before first discovering weed.

In the end, my commitment here is simple: Either I succeed, and go without for two months - which I believe to be the most likely scenario. Or I end up with a migraine so severe I simply am no longer willing to endure the pain. If that happens, I will accept that it's a necessary medication for my migraines, commit to stop wondering how things would be different without it, and ride out the remaining two months nearly sober but still allowing it for that medical use.

My intention here is that either way, my wondering will be solved. Either I find out what it's like without it, or I find out occasional use truly is necessary for me, and the side effects are better than many medications.",0,chanda_solo,1

After my previous post, I drew a massive mind map and looked at these 4 areas
-health
-career 
-family
-wealth

I started to reflect on what problems I had and what smoking weed has affected these areas, I guess also being in a place where weed is really dang hard to get also helps but the point is, you gotta set goals, you gotta stay busy and you got to reflect on yourself mercilessly.

I started working out, went from 90kg to 76kg, basically just went everyday cause the dopamine you get feels amazing, I would do weight training for an hour, and slow intensity cardio for 30 minutes. You can also use this time to listen to music, podcast or audiobooks to learn new stuff or just chill like I did, either way, this should make you tired and you get ur dopamine (kinda does a better job then weed lol)

I started dieting, cause I was fat, I can eat less (as long as I meet my protein goal) and save money and not feed and get munchies (screw sugar and processed foods) 

With my career, I started doing some volunteering work, and been working as a freelance, honestly this was the hardest part, weed gave me so much anxiety and depression, it took a while to learn to be confident and not be nervous talking to people, the brain fog makes it harder too. But being in shape helped with my confidence, and I just started working harder.

With family and friends, I started to reach out to people more, build connections back that were lost, I also tried making some new friends (it‚Äôs hard but at least I‚Äôm putting more effort into finding friends) the point is you gotta throw yourself out there.

With wealth, you just save so much money from not smoking weed lol. 

I‚Äôm not trying to flex or anything, to be honest I still have a long way to go, and as someone previously said, weed is just a part of the puzzle, through this time I worked through and still am working through a lot of personal issues, the point is if I can do it, I hope this can inspire you guys too.

There‚Äôs different ways to successfully quitting. But the point is this.

You gotta look yourself in the mirror and ask, is this really what you want your life to be?

I remember sitting on the toilet, feeling disgusted about myself, and I asked myself, why do I keep doing this. What‚Äôs the point of this. What if I tried?

What the state offered was just another opioid that could be used to get high, or sell for ‚Äúreal‚Äù drugs. It didn‚Äôt work, and I hated the weird culty vibes from the prayer circles at meetings (and NA was just a spot for dealers to push). 

I ended up getting to a point around 23 that I knew my life was either going to end or be spent in prison. I quit using a lot of cannabis, and have stayed clean for  what I‚Äôm just now realizing is over 15 years (I always say ten lmao). I don‚Äôt think about opioids every day, but with depression and the weight of responsibility of having a family, I have bad days, and weeks. Knowing I have a bowl for the end of the day helps me when my mind wanders. It‚Äôs been a wonder, and it helps with my PTSD and nightmares. I know others that got clean, and relapsed several times until they said screw it to the status quo, and opted to include cannabis in their sobriety. 

I‚Äôve had people and partners tell me I‚Äôm not really clean and i swapped one for the other. I don‚Äôt disagree and never claim to be a sober person. I enjoy alcohol responsibly as well, without issue. I tried an extended T-break several years into being clean, and ended up buying heroin.

zyv5t2,"anxious,dream,insomnia,no energy,sleep,worry",,petioles,"How I managed to stop smoking daily after 17 years of using | Hey all, longtime lurker on a throwaway. I started writing and deleted this post so many times, I'm not someone who likes to talk about themselves but since I see a lot of people here looking for help, support and advice, I figured it'd be good to give something back, considering I have been using for a while. I should say I'm not looking to quit, only to use less often.

The context: 

mid 30s M, been smoking weed every evening since 17 years. It was a highly functional addiction that didn't seem (emphasis on seem) to affect my life. What kept me going was the belief I had insomnia and that weed was the only solution to find sleep. Every evening, regardless of what time I got home, I'd need to spend at least 2 hours smoking and chilling in front of a screen in order to feel tired. In the last years, I ""discovered"" edibles, and as much as I enjoy them I realize they a) make me want to smoke more, until everything hits me like a ton of bricks and then I green out and b) as a result of a) they build up my tolerance and the next nights I needed to increase dosage to get the same buzz. 

I'd say in the last 5 years I kind of realized I wasn't enjoying weed as much as I did earlier, and that 60% of the time I'd roll up not because I really wanted it or needed it, but because specific moments and activities (especially end of the work day, getting back home and unwinding) were so strongly linked to weed. My entire schedule after sundown has been controlled by weed, I'm an introvert at heart so that's why it sort of comforted me, but I keep on thinking how many things I could achieve now that I'm longer tied down to weed. Also, I'd notice how on holidays were I'd take T-Breaks my sleep was shit, but even 5 hours sleep sober would make me feel better than 8 hours after having an indica joint before bed.

&#x200B;

How I kicked the habit: 

* 3 week trip away from home and all the usual triggers really helped take my mind of weed. I had no cravings, some insomnia at the beginning but since I went to a different timezone, I was dealing with jet lag anyway. I know not everyone is able to go to a different timezone, but if you feel like there are too many temptations, either remove them from your environment, or remove yourself from that environment
* Back home, the real challenge started as it was super tempting to get back into bad habits. I had to create some ground rules, inspired by this subreddit
   * no smoking during the week
   * smoking on weekend OK, after experimenting I found that I felt better and less guilty if I also avoided smoking 2 nights in a row. CBD tea or flowers after a session really helps feeling OK the next day and avoiding cravings.
   * if there are cravings, take a measured approach: CBD only joints and maybe moderate nicotine e cig usually do the trick. I drink very very seldom, but I found having a very light beer or alcopop gives me the slight buzz I am craving and then since I don't like being drunk, I don't have any desire to crack open another drink
   * also, I try filling my week nights up with activities that would totally suck if I was high: social events, nights out with family or SO, etc$
* also, and this is very important as a bad sleeper: invested in a white noise machine to help me fall asleep better and imposed a strict sleeping pattern: waking up everyday at 7am, regardless of the day or my schedule and going to bed around 11pm. This way, I am naturally tired in the evening, and the thought of smoking sounds completely pointless, like I'm already dozing off on my couch, what would be the point of wasting good weed if I know I'm going to fall asleep like a baby anyway.

&#x200B;

Results

* I'm always in a good mood, way less anxious (also greatly reduced coffee intake which was a crutch for weed hangovers let's be honest)
* I'm someone who dreams a lot, and I'm really enjoying having 2 to 3 vivid and memorable dreams a night, this has carried on well after the initial weaning period. This brings me so much joy, you have no idea, even the weird dreams that take me a few minutes to process and accept as not real.
* I feel sooo much more alert and motivated in the morning. I think my body was really used to the weed hangover, but it's kind of a high in itself to wake up and be ready for whatever the day has to offer.
* I was worried about waking up early and not being able to adjust to office hours, now I'm a total early bird and love the idea of getting shit done in the early morning.
* Of course, no more smokers cough, no more feeling like I have no energy but somehow really want to smoke, etc etc

Challenges up ahead

* I know edibles are better in the long run because no smoke. But I still strongly associate weed with the pleasures of smoking. I'd like to break that association eventually.
* I also want to go towards 1 session a week instead of 2. Right now what keeps me going is knowing that I'll have that session come Friday, and it's a great reward. But if I deconstruct this idea, I don't really like the idea that Fridays are automatically devoted to that. Want to plan more activities that suck while high during the weekend so I can get my mind off it. 
* So in a few months I will try to turn this into a bi-montly activity, or maybe take a weekend off each month at least, and see where that takes me.
* Finally, kind of avoiding hanging out with smokers during the week. Going to have to be strong next time one of my friends comes over and we watch a movie or something, but I'm kind of looking forward to that challenge.

It seems that the stronger the weed is, the less helpful it is to me. I think that's probably because I need more cbd and less thc, though I'm not completely sure. I've tried both hash and weed, and generally weed seems to work better, though mild hash (eg soap bar) is good just before bed.

I generally smoke with a small pipe, though I'm also experimenting with making vape liquid (without nicotine). For some reason the absolute best results are from smoking it with tobacco, but I've stopped that now (apart from very occasionally socially) as my lungs were suffering.

lqi69ar,"overwhelmed,sleep",,treedibles,"ok gave it a try today. after 6 days, nice very sour taste, like some extreme sour candies ..ofc with citric acid and kombucha/acetic acid ... no more strange smell like in the beginning, quite relieved about that. just tried 0.1 g of darkish pasty stuff which ought to be \~10 mg THC & CBD (source material is lab tested with 10% each). Dissolved nicely in mouth, can imagine would make nice sour touch if you put it in some soda or pure water or go with chicken or fish.



kept it in mouth for some minutes/""sublingual"" (not directly bc too sour, and chemical burns are a thing) then swallowed.

  
about 20 mins later definitely some subtle, yet noticeable effect of just ""feeling different"". About 1 h in onset of quite some sleepiness/chillaxation directing me towards the couch. chilling with some music and about another 1.5 h later it has kind of worn off. 

  
somehow feels different than using the same amount of for some seconds quick vaped weed in some hot cocoa with hi fat milk and letting it sit for like 10 mins. interestingly, the cocoa version gives me munchies, whereas the citric version didnt. 

  
so nothing overwhelming at this level, but not nothing. will definitely experiment with higher dosage step by step and also prepare thc only flower since it is so easy to prepare. yet i expected a little more bang since the word of mouth is that all of thc and cbd is decarbed and nothing lost. so lets see how the thc only works out, maybe it was the combo with cbd which weighed down on me a little. on the other hand getting ""sleepy"" is not a bug but a feature for many.

  
not sure if i try to keep this moist since it is a nice texture (high acidity should prevent it from going bad/moldy) or dry it and powder it like some recipes say.

so if you got some good quality bud at hand and have a little to spare, give it a try, material is definitely not wasted.",0,chanda_solo,1
lv6stbd,"anxiety,overwhelmed",,marijuana,"Hey great question! I‚Äôm 35. I worked as a higher level medical professional for a very long time, so because of college and then career, I never consumed marijuana. 
I left the field a few years ago (different subreddit haha) and decided to try marijuana about a year ago for depression/anxiety. It was a miracle, and along with some major life changes, im here now and happier than ever. Now I use marijuana more for meditation/relaxation in the evening instead of the medicine it started as for me. (So incredibly grateful to be able to say that.) 

Because I didn‚Äôt/dont have any friends or family who smoke, and live in an illegal state‚Ä¶..the easiest way to start was buy a ready-to-smoke disposable vape while visiting a legal state. Things like bongs and dabs, and even packing a bowl feels very overwhelmed for a newcomer with no one to ask.

1l05vob,"fear,overwhelmed,pain,panic,paranoia,slept",,trees,"The highest I've ever been and yet my best trip (scary at the time) | I didn‚Äôt go into it expecting much. Honestly, I just wanted a light buzz, nothing crazy. I‚Äôd smoked enough to know my limits. My friend had a distillate pen, and I took a couple puffs.

Fifteen minutes passed. Nothing.

I remember telling my friend, and he just frowned, said, ‚ÄúWeird. It should‚Äôve hit by now.‚Äù So, thinking maybe it was just not enough, I took another big puff deeper this time. In that moment, I genuinely believed I had it under control.

Still, nothing seemed off yet. I felt light, maybe a little floaty, but still present. I told a friend I was hungry, and we stepped out to get an empanada before heading back to class. 

But something shifted in the bathroom mirror. I looked at myself and immediately knew. My eyes were bloodshot, like I hadn‚Äôt slept in days. 

I walked back to my friend and said, ‚ÄúHey, I already feel a bit high.‚Äù And as if on cue, as if the trip had been waiting for a dramatic entrance, the moment I stepped through the classroom door it hit.

My mouth felt like jelly. Not numb, not dry, just weird. Wavy. Like it wasn‚Äôt solid. Like it moved a second behind the rest of me. I focused everything I had on walking to my seat without stumbling. My inner voice was yelling, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trip, man. Don‚Äôt let them see you‚Äôre high. Just act normal.‚Äù

When I finally sat down, I looked at my friend and said, ‚ÄúDude, this hit me hard.‚Äù He glanced over, calm as ever, and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna get worse. But chill, we‚Äôre here.‚Äù That was both comforting and terrifying.

Then came the sensations ‚Äî waves through my body. Not metaphorical ones. It felt like I was being vibrated from the inside, like my entire chest was tuned to some deep frequency. My throat felt like there was something sharp pressed gently against it. Not painful ‚Äî just present, just strange.

My mind? It had left the room. I wasn‚Äôt there anymore. I was having vivid thoughts, not visuals, but places my mind would slip into. Imagining myself elsewhere, lost in scenarios that weren‚Äôt happening. Not hallucinations, more like immersive daydreams that felt real for a few seconds, then snapped away. I‚Äôd forget I was sitting in a classroom until something external, a classmate speaking, a movement, a blink brought me back.

That was the rhythm: float away, come back.

Leave. Return. Again and again.

At some point, the teacher announced a 15-minute break. That threw me off. Suddenly I was surrounded by people, movement, decisions. I didn‚Äôt want to move, let alone interact. But I followed the flow, walking out with the rest. My paranoia was through the roof. I kept asking classmates, ‚ÄúHey, do I look high?‚Äù One after another. Most of them didn‚Äôt notice or didn‚Äôt care, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the fear that everyone knew.

Then, as if the universe thought it‚Äôd be funny, someone scolded me for smoking weed. Not a teacher, just some guy. I can‚Äôt even remember what he said exactly, just that it made me feel small, guilty, and exposed.

I returned to the classroom after the break and everything intensified.

The vibrations were stronger. The disconnection deeper. I could feel sound in my body, weird to say, but true. I felt like I was surrounded by invisible waves that my ears couldn‚Äôt hear, but my body could somehow feel.

And I wasn‚Äôt me anymore ‚Äî not completely. There was no panic at that point, just a strange sense of unfamiliarity with myself. My identity felt... thinner. My thoughts didn‚Äôt sound like mine. I was watching myself exist rather than existing.

Still no visuals, but in my head I was places ‚Äî tunnels, vast plains, dark spaces, water, light, nowhere. I was imagining places so intensely they felt real for a few seconds. Then I‚Äôd turn my head and snap back into reality like surfacing from underwater.

That motion, just moving my head, grounded me. That became my anchor. The only thing that reminded me I was still in that classroom, still in my body, still here.

I spent the rest of the class quiet. Barely moved. Just let the experience pass through me like a storm. I didn‚Äôt resist it anymore ‚Äî just surrendered to it.

When class ended, everyone left. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone. I asked a friend, ‚ÄúHey dude, stick with me please. I‚Äôm really high.‚Äù He stayed. We walked together, slowly, until we reached a quiet green area nearby.

I lit a cigarette. And I swear to God, it was the best-tasting thing I‚Äôve ever smoked.

Something about that moment, the fresh air, the sun cutting through leaves, the nicotine ‚Äî it all just clicked. The trip was fading. I could feel myself landing, slowly, like a plane touching down after hours of turbulence.

It was over.

Not in a dramatic, fireworks-ending kind of way ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ done. A soft landing after a wild ride.

Looking back, it wasn‚Äôt a bad trip. Intense? Definitely. Overwhelming at times? Without question. But I learned something from it ‚Äî how to ride the wave instead of fighting it. How to breathe through the chaos, stay present even when your mind wants to float off.

Since then, every trip‚Äôs been better. Calmer. Clearer. That one? That was the trial by fire, and I made it through.

And yeah. I‚Äôd do it again. Just not in class next time.",0,chanda_solo,1
d2dr50j,"pain,sweating",,trees,"no, being shitty is stealing from people and not feeling bad at it. With heroin, you can either feel the most intense horrible pain you've felt in your life (And I've been in a car crash that punctured my lung, broke all my ribs, and bruised my liver and spleen) and withdrawal from opiates feels worse, so the compulsion to just not feel dopesick can lead people to do bad things, its the only thing on their mind, but once they get high all they feel is guilt. I hang out with junkies. A lot. So many of them feel this way. Hell, then they use again to get rid of the pain of accepting what they've done.

To be honest, I hope it never happens to you, but if you get strung out on the streets, and get part of the community (and yes it is a community), if you're hopelessly sick, you'll have people offering you their last hit just to get you well because they've been there before.

I mean like salvia-style trips, wife almost calling an ambulance, inability to drive, so many other crazy ass things I had never experienced before as a regular weed smoker for 18 years before moving to pens only because I was tired of smelling around my family. It was absolutely terrible and I still went through it over and over because I rationalized why I needed to keep smoking (a true tell tale sign of any addiction) and that it was me and my fucked up mentals and not the 98% thc I was sucking on 4-5 times a day. Finally the last spiraling ‚Äútrip‚Äù I had was so existential that I said to myself this shit just ain‚Äôt for me anymore. I went without for a week and then smoked three hits from a J and got a similar feeling but not as extreme so I just reminded myself that this wasn‚Äôt for me anymore.  Stopped for two and a half months, and two days ago I shared a joint with my brother and felt like I used to and just ok with it. After reading up on why I was going through what I was going through, I guess the concentrate in my muscles and brain tissue were so potent and so high that it took a while for it all to cleanse out. So when I tried to smoke a week after, it was still in me and I spiked back up. I still feel WAY better off of weed completely so I‚Äôm ok stopping now and just treating it as a recreational thing with the family or the homies once and a great while where I can just take a drag or two and be feeling great.

They didn't say for him to give up weed, even agreed that for some, mj use helps reduce anxiety. It was the dabs they told him to quit, and to smoke flower in moderation. The levels of THC in dabs are so high that some people can't handle it, it has exactly the opposite effect, more so with people who have existing anxiety issues. But dabs did play a part in this episode, I have no doubt. I've known him for 25+ years, both on and off the meds, but he's only been dabbing for 6 months. His behavior changed, hard to explain, his tolerance since dabbing is off the charts, more than I've ever seen. It was a bad combo of no meds and way too much dabbing.

p73k6n,"anxiety,dream,stinging",,mmj,"MMJ connection with B12 and depression | **Bottom Line:** I have found that MMJ seems to interact with my Vitamin B12 levels.  I have promising evidence that a generic ""Multi-B"" vitamin has caused extreme improvements with my mental healthin certain circumstances, and also improves how well MMJ medicates me.  I get side effects ONLY WHILE MEDICATING WITH MMJ that would be explained by a B12 deficiency.

**The details:**

I have had 2 very solid ""cause and effect"" test cases that back up what I'm about to say.  I am going to continue testing, but I think it is ok to bring this up here.  Testing requires subjecting myself to negatives and is hard.  Of course I am aware of placebo effects and I am trying very hard to eliminate those as a possibility.  I feel like MMJ should be triggering placebo effects if I'm going to have any.

1) I have depression and anxiety and have been going through the regular systems for getting treatment.  At this point, I have done extensive, expensive treatments to try to see an improvement and everything has been a failure.  Enter MMJ.  I have found that sometimes I feel so ""drained"" that MMJ can't even give me a positive boost like it normally does.  This drained feeling makes you think that there must be some biological problem, but therapy and medical professionals so far have told me that it's most likely all about my emotions, things we can't treat with a pill.

This can go on for weeks for me.  Now, I have had 2 cases where I have taken a ""B100 complex"" generic multivitamin (contents listed at the bottom), and my mood has lifted within hours AND MMJ BECOMES MORE EFFECTIVE.  There are more ties to MMJ below.

2) I have had an expensive ""micronutrient"" test done, and the test did not return results of any deficiencies in B vitamins.

3) I know I have an MTHFR gene mutation from a test, which has to do with your body's processing of b vitamins.  All along I have been taking the recommended supplements (methylfolate) and at this point doctors believe I am getting what I need in order to treat MTHFR.

4) I asked my PCP about my seeming problem with B vitamins.  She said that my case was unusual, and that for a B vitamin deficiency symptom she would look for tingling in the feet, and stinging senations.

5) I have been getting exactly these sensations when I medicate with MMJ.  I am still working to confirm if the symptoms are tied to particular strains, of it's more of a matter of quantity of THC, frequency of use, etc.  I confirmed the sensations with the doctor and to her it sounded like an exact match for what they would expect from a vitamin B12 deficiency.  We thought it was a low visibility, sporadic athlete's foot problem for 2 months.

So yeah, right now I'm looking at the dream situation of ""I found a pill to cure depression"" (it's more complicated but it's huge).  It's also a horror situation that medical professionals couldn't figure this out for over a decade.

In case any of this rings true to folks, I have some other weird reactions to MMJ, such as feelings of chest heat and flushness that seem to be prevalent when I take TOO LITTLE MMJ.  The less I take, the worse the heat is.  If I medicate normally, **sometimes** over time as the MMJ wears off and the heat stays around for a long time.  It is the biggest negative I have in this otherwise extremely helpful medication.  I am still figuring out how to dose and cause-effects of strains, otherwise I'd be more certain of what's going on when I DON'T get these symptoms.

I have asked about allergies, and the PCP didn't think my symptoms would align with an allergic reaction.  I have tested with Benadryl with inconclusive results.

Also, I used to drink a lot of monster energy drinks, which include some B12.  It might be that I developed a problem in my body by drinking it too much, but it's also possible that I had unconsciously found a ""cure"" to my deficiency without understanding what was going on.  Like some twisted take on how ancient humans discovered treatments.

**What I'm taking:**

This is a generic multi-B vitamin from a grocery store.  I have spoken to a nutritionist, and she mentioned that there are ""high quality"" b supplements that use different sources.  I am planning to test what happens.

Ingredients (I'm rounding the percentages): thiamin 100mg (8000%), Riboflavin 100 mg (7700%), Niacin 100mg (600%), Vitamin B6 100mg, Folate 680 mcg DFE (400 mcg folic acid) (170%), Vitamin B12 100 mcg (4000%), Biotin 100mcg (300%), Pantotheric Acid 100mg (2000%).

I usually take half a tablet.  I have found that it can take more than that to build up a ""saturation"" where I start to urinate nuclear yellow.  I'm trying to use that as a gauge to see how long it takes to reach a point of ""saturation"" when I supplement.   If it takes more supplementation some days for my body to saturate, that might be useful data.

Cyanobalamin is what my nutritionist said could be better.  It looks like it's the cheap way of providing B12 in a supplement but I need to do more reading.",1,chanda_solo,1

I used the exact same dose of the exact same strain (star tribe) with the exact same workflow first thing.  I had a very intense indica type high (similar to gg#4) with the various stages people talk about (curiosity, bliss, philosophical, racing mind, curiosity).  It has been 6 hours and I am still not good to drive.  Zero sweating today.  The only obvious explanations I have are ""wake and bake"" effect, and/or my body had an initial reaction yesterday, and by today that reaction has run its course?  Only negative side effects after 6 hours have been stinging sensations in mucous membranes of the head (eyes, tongue, sinuses) and dry mouth.

Edit 5: I used half of my normal dose (0.007 / 2 = 0.0035 oz or less) and my volcano to fill 4 bags according to this workflow: https://www.reddit.com/r/VolcanoVaporizer/comments/csv3a6/volcano_hybrid_workflows_what_you_got/exh7p41?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
After inhaling only the hottest bag (just a hunch, 390 - 400 degF) my sweating stopped within 5 minutes and my headache is much better.  

It seems my path forward is to see if can manage to not get sweaty AGAIN in 2 hours.  I could also mess around with the other 3 bags.  There are lots of possible explanations for this.

Edit 4: it has been 2.5 hours of profuse sweating, headache, heart pounding.  2 hours of ""medicated"" then 2.5 hours and still counting of these reactions. 

Edit 3: ok so now after being a seven on a scale of 1 - 10, 4 hours later I start sweating like I would on a day where I considered mmj a failure.  My ears are ringing.  Heart pounding.  Also sinus issues and a splitting headache but possibly unrelated. So I get very high off of the same amount of the same strain as yesterday.  And I‚Äôm using the same quantity, which I‚Äôm told is pretty small 0.007 oz, likely less.  I have been thinking these symptoms were those of simply taking too much, but this pattern isn‚Äôt anything I‚Äôve read of and it doesn‚Äôt seem familiar to anyone responding. 

Edit2:

**Look at the original post:   I wrote 4 PARAGRAPHS, and every single response has only been to the FIRST SENTENCE.**

Ok.  Now look I'm not saying this is the most bulletproof argument in the world, but right now I'm feeling a full effect with no flushing or sweating.  Last night and the night before I was just getting sweaty etc etc. with the same strain and the same quantity.

**IF** it were ONLY tolerance then what is happening now?  **There wasn't a t-break, it has been 18 hours.**

**I just want to know what's different between then and now!**  I never said anything about t-breaks, y'all brought it up and I had to defend against that instead of the obvious stuff, like: ""NO T-BREAK -> GOT BETTER... WHY???    T-BREAK -> NO GOT BETTER... WHY???""

Edit: Everyone suggesting the t-break: Thank you, but I have reasons for not writing it off as a t-break issue.  I spent a lot of time going into some details in my post, and my t-break experiments have been busts:

1. I have taken 3 week breaks from mmj and come back to nothing but despair.  Usually, instead of a t-break something else just ""snaps"" and I get back.  Maybe I accidently take a super strong hit of a certain strain and that un-sticks me.  Maybe I use RSO and magically it unsticks me.  But I can't get a correlation between getting ""unstuck"" and a t-break.  I have tried and had my hopes destroyed by relying on t-breaks.  And I've recovered **without** taking a t-break, but which I can't reproduce or understand it.
2. I'm trying to ask some detailed questions about more vs less and content mix because **that's making a difference** right now, day to day.  If it were a straight across the board tolerance problem, how likely is that I'm getting great results one day and not the next, and mixed results based on my temperatures?  A chance, sure.  Maybe day 2 works because I took a super high dose pushing through the tolerance, but then day 3 I'm running high temperatures but not getting anything at all. But then day 4 I take a different mix with lower temps and get results again.  It doesn't add up to being a straight up tolerance issue.
3. **And how do you account for the differences you get from switching forms (edible, concentrate, flower) into the grand unifying theory that it's all just tolerance?**
4. I'm not experiencing weaker effects, I'm experiencing either zero or all effects, like a switch.  Plus I get really **sweaty and feverish** all over on some days but not others.  Two MMJ pharmacists haven't heard about that happening.  That's why I brought it here.
5. Also I'm sorry I used the term ""OD"" loosely, I meant to describe the feeling when you take wayyy too much and you are stuck with nausea on the couch for 10+ hours.

Edit 2:  I just measured that I usually medicate with 0.007 grams of flower.  In case my scale is broken, here is a photo.  [https://imgur.com/a/XjUaxYA](https://imgur.com/a/XjUaxYA)  I don't run into numbers very often, but from context this might be relatively very small which might indicate that my mode of reacting is not ""normal.""

Original Post:

Hi, so I had a really good 8 months with concentrates until they just stopped working.  Taking advice, I am switching over to flower.  I'm having a hard time working with it.  I invested in a volcano so I can switch up my temperatures and target certain terpenes.  I'm pretty sure that while I'm going after terpenes, THCA-&gt;THC conversion is another factor.

I have a problem where I just get feel feverish/flushed after vaping, but I don't get much of an effect in my head where it is required :)  Just last night I found that maybe I had been seeing this as getting too close to an overdose, but actually I need to add MORE not less, and maybe I'm skimping out too much on the high temperature side (once you get past \~400 it gets harsh and I start to worry about OD, but that's where Linalool, humulene, and THCv hang out).

This is all exhausting and I'm in a lot more pain and a lot less relief since I had to switch away from concentrates.   On the other hand, maybe I can learn a bit more about why I get flushed sometimes.

Has anyone else been in a similar boat, or does anyone have any advice on flower vs concentrate?  I'm starting to think maybe with flower you can't really get the same results.

Thank you.",1,chanda_solo,1

A rant: | Last month, I started having nausea and vomiting some days, a few moments after eating food‚Ä¶ doctors told me it was CHS, so I stopped smoking for 2 weeks.. however, the urge to still smoke was still there‚Ä¶ so I started smoking again I didn‚Äôt feel any negative effect on my stomach‚Ä¶ until the last few days. Now keep in mind when I started smoking again, I only smoked half a joint then a Whole joint the next day.. it wasn‚Äôt until a few days later, when I met up with my stoner friends, that I started going overboard .. ripping the bong multiple times throughout the hours, smoking multiple joints etc. 

As for symptoms timeline: 

1. I went on a bad binge the other night when I had the munchies, definitely felt a little uneasy in the stomach the following day but no nausea/vomiting. 

2. These last few days, my boyfriend, who does not partake, has been visiting me, so I haven‚Äôt smoked.. during this time I thought I felt myself have little appetite.. not nausea but just not much desire to eat/finish meals.. And I wouldn‚Äôt say I had NO appetite.. last night I got very hungry randomly lol, nevertheless, I have eaten a lot since he was down here.. but this morning, we went out to breakfast, and moments after finishing my sandwich, I felt the urge to vomit extremely strongly.. I rushed to the bathroom, where I gagged a little bit, but wasn‚Äôt able to throw up.. haven‚Äôt had any diarrhea either besides, the day after my binge.. just this episode today.. 

After what happened last month, I‚Äôve been so paranoid every time I smoke, analyzing every little thing my stomach feels/does that regardless of if I have CHS or not, this was probably bound to happen with that level of fear‚Ä¶ 

Anyway, needless to say, I‚Äôm pretty upset. I kinda just feel like: man, I can never have nice things.. lol.. But this is what I get for not listening to advice the first time‚Ä¶ not to mention how difficult these last few weeks of summer have been, with dealing with a loss, getting eczema, work trouble and being sick a lot.. I‚Äôve been really depressed and when I smoked after my T-break, I felt so uplifted, kinda like all the depression just melted away‚Ä¶ unlike what my anti-depressants/anxiety meds do lol. 

Anyway, I was in denial when doctors were telling me I had CHS the last time, for a few reasons, but I guess they were right. When I stopped smoking, I didn‚Äôt feel sick after about a week of not consuming. Now that I‚Äôve started consuming again, the vomiting is back‚Ä¶ looks like I‚Äôm gonna have to quit for good, ya‚Äôll.

1kje1y3,"anxious,nap,sleep,tired all the time",,leaves,"Its been about a month, but I'm still lazy and lethargic. | I started smoking in around 2007, at around age 12, and completely stopped April of this year, age 29. I was a daily smoker and only quit about 2 times in the 17‚Äì18-year period. First was for about 5 months because I was on probation at 15 years old (for, you guessed it, getting caught with weed), and for a few months in 2021 to help my husband quit long enough to get a job that required a clean test result. During the break in '21, I felt great, and I think that's what got me curious about sobriety. As I aged, I couldn't handle it anymore. I'd get anxious and green out. Every hit opened a can of worms, but I did it every day. I eventually got to the point where I told myself that I no longer wanted my days to be a cycle of being sober and wanting whatever pleasure came from weed -> Smoking -> Getting paranoid and waiting it out -> Wasting a full day of waiting out the high to be able to function -> Rinse and repeat. 

  
My question is, after almost 2 decades of chronic use and stopping for 6 weeks, is it normal to feel lazy, lethargic, and unmotivated? I feel just as useless sober as I did while smoking daily. I have seen a slight improvement in getting things done, though. I can do 2-3 major tasks a day instead of 1. Basic tasks wipe me out and I feel like I have to budget my energy on the highest priorities, which lately have been working out, cooking my breakfast, a load of laundry (washed and dried, but not put away), and making dinner for husband when he gets off work. Getting myself to do anything else is like pulling teeth. I also feel tired all the time. No matter how much I sleep, whether its 7, 8, or 9 hours, I feel like it's never enough. I'm fine about an hour after waking up and I do not nap during the day anymore. Despite this improvement, I feel like its not what I expected to see after quitting. I thought I would be able to take on the world.

Funny enough I never enjoyed weed in high school or even early university, but it slowly sunk its claws into me as I used it as a ‚Äúboredom buster‚Äù on week nights. I have ADHD and insomnia so of course I was more drawn to it over time due to the initially positive outcomes from smoking. 

Cut to now and going a day felt intolerable. It absolutely played a role in the downfall of my last relationship and the need to constantly numb myself just to avoid any discomfort was only making my anxiety worse. 

Changed jobs, started making better money, met a girl who loves me and bought us a house. Life‚Äôs good but still couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling like weed was holding me back. It was easy at first to keep smoking because my gf smokes too, but my job is high stress and it started to feel like I was only getting high to try and numb myself to the stress.

cliiik,"anxiety,stress",,cbdinfo,"Introduction post for our CBD company | Hello Everyone, I hope you are all doing Amazing, 

I will follow the best I can the rules from "" **How to post as a CBD brand.** "" 

&#x200B;

So I am Lucas, co-founder of **plantandhemp**, a CBD product company (obviously)

Until now we distribute other brands that we trust ( you know how much quality is important regarding CBD) but soon we will have our own products. Only the flowers are ours ( and we are proud of them)üå±.  

We started last year and we want to grow a lot, we know the road will be long, but I know it will be worth.

We consider CBD, as a tool given by Nature. A tool that can potentially help you improve your life. Except that if you are not aware or educate, you can skip things that are important for you (and not just about CBD)

 So what we want to do, is to give you the qualities tools, with the knowledge that goes with it.    


But our mission does not stop to CBD. We want to share knowledge through the concept of the  ""**grow together**"".

We want to provide tools so everyone can move forward and progress in their lives.

 

**Let me explain!**

To put it simply, If CBD is a tool given by nature that can bring us something, our brain is also a tool, which serves us to live, to perceive the world. 

Why 2 people who live the same things don‚Äôt react the same way?  One of the answers that we wanted to bring, is: the way we use our brain, the way we see things. How life impact us and how we react to it?

We live our life, through our eyes, through our feelings, our emotions, and for each person on earth it's the same thing, there are 7 billion people, 7 billion different points of view, and it's these differences that will make us move forward and learn collectively.

Differences shouldn‚Äôt set us apart, it should gather us, to make us grow.

The more we come to perceive the world from different angles, the more we will find solutions to our problems.

We learn from others, we learn from differences. If there were only Lucas on earth, we would all have the same point of view, there would be no war, there will be good humor, confetti everywhere, but we will still live in caves...

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that we know everything, it is the opposite, I am saying that together we will give material for everyone to learn.

The idea and the ""how"" is still in process, and we will use Reddit a lot ( and of course any help, feedback is very welcome).

&#x200B;

I know I went a bit far off topic from CBD, but as CBD is a ""business"", it is where we are going to start. This plant has already helped a lot of people I know to relieve from stress and anxiety and I am sad to see that this PLANT is still banned and misunderstood.    
We want to help humanity to get back on track and reconnect with nature and with itself (just that \^\^).  


So that is who we are, if you have any question, feedback, observation ( if it is constructive ofc \^\^) please let me know

In terms of sleep specifically, THC-free CBD can still provide the anxiety relieving properties and can be used to treat insomnia. Products can be infused with other sleep-inducing properties such as melatonin and certain [terpenes](https://www.allpremiumcbd.com/cannabis-derived-terpenes/) or natural oils that promote sleep anxiety reduction and relaxation. Most notably, the potential sedative effects of the terpene [Myrcene](https://www.allpremiumcbd.com/cannabis-derived-terpenes/) have been increasingly studied in recent years.

micppom,"insomnia,melatonin,sleep",,cbdoilreviews,"I've recently reviewed a few of Akira's new line of sublingual oils, including their ""Relief"" oil and ""Relax"" oil. Check my profile if you'd like to see those reviews. This review is their ""Sleep"" oil and is, as the name implied, aimed at helping with insomnia or restless sleep. The review will repeat some of the same information as the last two, such as the type of bottle, oil extraction process, and taste since those things are all pretty much consistent across the line of oils.


‚Ä¢ Note: Since this is a full spectrum product, there are still some traces of THC present (about 3mg per serving) so if you are sensitive to THC keep that in mind.


Bottle - The tincture comes in a 1oz (30ml) dropper bottle. Two things I appreciate about the bottles they use over other tinctures I have had are that the dropper is marked with ml increments to make dosing easier, and it has a child resistant dropper cap that you have to press down to unscrew. It adds a little extra peace of mind if you have little ones around. The label on the bottle has all the information you would expect, including dosage, suggested use, and nutritional facts. There's also a QR code that takes you to a direct download link for the labs.


Labs - The labs are from GreenLeaf Lab and show a total of 2600mg of CBD, along with 1100mg of CBN, 80mg of THC, and 54mg of CBC. This comes out to about 87mg of CBD, 37mg of CBN, 3mg of THC, and 2mg of CBC per 1ml dropper. The bottle doesn't mention the THC content on the label, but it is mentioned on their website that it contains some trace amounts. This comes to around 128mg total cannabinoids per dropper, very close to the advertised 133.3mg per dropper. There are also labs for pesticides, residual solvents, microbials, metals, foreign materials, and mycotoxins, all of which are clear with nothing detected.


Oil - One of the things that makes Akira's sublinguals stand out is their oil, which is processed from their own organically grown hemp flower using subcritical CO2 extraction that does not use heat or chemicals. This means that the oil contains lots of other minor cannabinoids as well as other natural molecules like amino acids, vitamins, omega fatty acids, etc. and no residual solvents like ethanol or butane. For this particular oil there is also CBN added, probably in the form of an isolate.


Taste - Because of this natural extraction process that preserves a lot of the terpenes and compounds of the plant, the taste reflects this with a very natural but also hempy tasting oil. There are no flavorings or anything added, only the hemp oil/CBN isolate and MCT oil as a carrier. The taste is pretty heavily hempy with earthiness and even a little skunkiness. If you are sensitive to that flavor you will probably struggle with the taste of this tincture, but I actually enjoy the natural flavor of it and it helps me feel good about what's actually in it and what I'm putting in my body.


Effects - To begin with, this is a pretty strong oil at 4000mg and around 130mg per dropper. Also, although CBD is pretty much non-psychoactive, CBN can be mildly psychoactive for some people, especially in bigger doses and if you are sensitive to THC. Add to that the roughly 3mg of THC in a full dropper and this is one that's definitely best to start out with a smaller amount and work your way up to see how it effects you. I would recommend starting with maybe even 1/4 dropper and going from there unless you already know your tolerance level well. I also would definitely recommend only taking this before bed since it will make you pretty drowsy and sluggish feeling if taken during the day. It's primary function is to help with sleep, however, and at that it absolutely excels. The CBN really helps with that heavy sleep feeling and the CBD is so relaxing it becomes really easy to drift off. I take it about 30 minutes before bed and start feeling it in roughly that time frame, thought it's about an hour for me to have it fully kick in. I am often already asleep by that time though. I generally only take this on days when I don't have to be up early the next morning because with a big enough dose I can still feel a little drowsy the next morning, though it fades quickly and I'm usually fully alert and ready to go within an hour of waking. If you are new to CBN though, I would make sure you don't try this for the first time on a night when you have to be somewhere early the next day. I find this a lot more effective than melatonin for helping me sleep since with melatonin I fall asleep quickly, but often wake up half way through the night and can't get back to sleep. I generally sleep well throughout the night after taking this and feel well rested.


Conclusion - This is one of the strongest sleep products out there in the CBD space so approach with caution, but if you are after something natural to help with staying asleep this is a great choice. The taste might be challenging to some if you are sensitive to the taste of hemp, but I don't mind it personally and this is my current go to if I want to guarantee a good night's sleep, though I generally only use it on nights when I don't have to up to early the next morning.",1,chanda_solo,1
hisbktq,"anxiety,stress",,cbdoilreviews,"IMO sublingual is the way to go and brand does matter more more than anything. CBDforthepeople is a brand that I trust without a doubt. Green Roads is another but both are pricey. 

I started using CBD for overall well being and health. I heard about it from someone who told me her husband was on 4 meds for anxiety and depression and was unable to work for months and tried CBD for the people and got off all his meds in less than 2 weeks. The name sounds cheesy to me but I thought I would try it for general stress and repair from training and it was a game changer for me. Tried a bunch of brands and the two I mentioned above are by far the best. Hope this helps. Let me know how it works out and also remember that diet and gut health is paramount to any medication. Not just saying this, it is. Next is exercise even if it‚Äôs just walking. Do it consistently every day. Water, water, water. No soft drinks, cut the sugar, cut out or minimize processed foods. Stay diligent with the above and you may very well get to where you need and want to be without the harsh side effects of meds. Good luck and do respond back to this thread with updates.

gu2u5mk,"insomnia,melatonin,sleep",,cbdoilreviews,"I am a CBD Advocate and Educator. CBD alone is very helpful with sleep. Melatonin use is not encouraged as a normal routine but only in circumstances to help short term situations. This is a lot of information and possibly too long to read but it is what I consider helpful. It‚Äôs probably not helping you the way you think. 

- [ ] Melatonin is a very popular sleep aid. It‚Äôs naturally produced in your body. You don‚Äôt need a prescription for it and can buy it in gummy form or in a fruity drink. It‚Äôs also VERY popular in CBD now. 

- [ ] But is it as effective and safe as we think?

- [ ] Natural melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, helps humans fall asleep ‚Äï and synthetic melatonin has been available as a sleep aid for nearly three decades. But the synthetic version‚Äôs effects have not been extensively studied, and since it‚Äôs classified as a ‚Äúdietary supplement,‚Äù it is almost completely unregulated by the FDA.

- [ ] It‚Äôs important to take a closer look at this common supplement. ‚ÄúAny person in the sleep world will tell you the same thing: melatonin is not harmless, is vastly overused and should not be used as a sleep aid to treat insomnia,‚Äù Michael Grandner, a sleep researcher at the University of Arizona, told HuffPost.

- [ ] Melatonin is meant to reset the body‚Äôs internal clock ‚Äï for example, it‚Äôs appropriate to use the supplement to counter the effects of jet lag, or help someone sleep if they have an unusual work schedule or suffer from a circadian rhythm disorder. It should not be used for general insomnia.

- [ ] The proper dosage, according to a seminal 2001 study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is 0.3 milligrams. The research was conducted by Richard Wurtman, who pioneered the pharmaceutical use of melatonin as a sleep aid in 1994. Pills and supplements often sell 10 times that suggested amount in a single dose. This can lead to higher plasma melatonin levels the next day, which can cause a ‚Äúhangover‚Äù effect that leaves users groggy.

- [ ] According to a 2005 meta-analysis of melatonin studies from MIT, also led by Wurtman, researchers found that the widely available high doses of melatonin are ineffective. ‚ÄúAfter a few days, it stops working,‚Äù wrote Wurtman, in a press release accompanying the study. When the brain‚Äôs melatonin receptors are exposed to too much of the hormone, they become unresponsive, he said.

- [ ] Melatonin may also be unsafe for children. David Kennaway, the director of the circadian physiology lab at the University of Adelaide in Australia, told Science Daily that the use of melatonin to treat children‚Äôs sleep disorders is ‚Äúrather alarming.‚Äù
- [ ] He said there is ‚Äúextensive evidence from laboratory studies that melatonin causes changes in multiple physiological systems, including cardiovascular, immune and metabolic systems, as well as reproduction in animals,‚Äù and its effects on children‚Äôs developing bodies is yet unstudied.
- [ ] ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòsafe‚Äô is used very freely and loosely with this drug,‚Äù said Kennaway, ‚Äúbut there have been no rigorous, long-term studies‚Äù

- [ ] Even for adults, the unregulated nature of the supplement gives cause for reconsideration. Although synthetic melatonin is ‚Äúchemically identical‚Äù to natural melatonin, commercially available supplements ‚Äúoften contain fillers, inert and other ingredients that may cause effects that would not be expected with natural melatonin,‚Äù Clete Kushida, a sleep researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, told HuffPost in an email.",1,chanda_solo,1

the bud sometimes feels a bit dry/stale on the outside but 5 days in a hot box in the back of metal box truck with no humidity pack will do that.

For a while, I‚Äôve just felt like a chump seeing the only legal online option for anything related to the good lush being CBD. Aside from radically progressive states and locations that are forward thinking with weed, California and Canada come to mind allowing you to get your shit like it‚Äôs from the dominos app, it seems as if Delta 8 is the best chance at getting that exchange for something that‚Äôll leave you feeling more than a little light in your sneakers.

I‚Äôm excited to try this, though to tell you the truth there is nothing quite like the disorientation and anxiety/paranoia that comes with pure THC, though I can see why that would be off-putting to a lot of people, especially more productive members of society.

hlwb63d,"anxiety,anxious,paranoia",,eldertrees,"I know non anxious people who enjoy that feeling of anxiety.

For you, all mental health aside, coping with all cannabis effects is 100% down to mental control. Yes, anxiety feels like shit, so fix your surroundings and mental state to reduce its intensity. It will never go away afaik, because you are messing with your brain chemistry.

I have never lived in a legal state, so idk if you can completely eliminate all sources of anxiety, obviously doing something illegal that chemically induces paranoia is going to lead to anxiety.

If you really want to keep using weed then you will teach yourself self control. Meditation, mindfulness, creation, art, music, movies, whatever you can do to enforce some kind of direction to your mental state. 

I think the best thing to do is just smoke a bit until you get paranoid and then stop tbh. I don't really think the rewards of pushing beyond paranoia are worth it. Accept it, and just find some weed that doesn't make you as paranoid.

You can push past anxiety, and the muscular spasms that cause sickness (whiteys, green ones, whatever), into somatic control, and on into pure psychedelia. Pushing into the psychedelic area through long term use is dangerous because the time to come down is in weeks, whereas when reached with single dose edibles it is in hours.

also, some strains can actually exacerbate anxiety so there‚Äôs that. since i suffer from 3 anxiety disorders i research all the strains i smoke. if any of them promote anxiety (and many of them do) i give those a miss. sativa strains are often the culprit, at least for me. i tend towards hybrids and indicas because of this.

Nicotine is physically addictive, it is nearly impossible to quit because your brain tells you it needs it like it needs water. When I experience nicotine withdrawal I cannot function at all 

I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt be addictive in a psychological sense, after all you want to keep feeling good so you‚Äôll yeah you‚Äôll want to keep smoking, but if you ever decided to take a t-break it wouldn‚Äôt be the hardest thing ever",0,chanda_solo,1
l1tde9e,"anxiety,discomfort",,saplings,"A great line I once heard from a friend‚Äîsometimes weed quits us before we quit it. It really captures how our relationship with cannabis can evolve, often beyond our control. As our bodies and circumstances change, so can the way we react to it.

Switching up the strains might help, focusing on those with a higher CBD to THC ratio, or even opting for just CBD, which is less likely to trigger anxiety. Cutting back on the quantity might also do the trick, giving your body a chance to reset.

Also, since the legalization, one of the significant advantages has been the ability to know exactly how much THC you're consuming, especially with edibles. This precise dosing can really help manage how intense your experience is, making it easier to avoid too much, which can lead to anxiety or discomfort. Edibles provide a different type of high, often more intense and longer-lasting, so starting with a low dose and going slow is key to finding what works best for you.

And one more tip, switching to a dry herb vaporizer can also make a big difference. Vaping tends to provide a cleaner high compared to smoking. It heats the cannabis at a lower temperature than burning it, which means you get more of the beneficial compounds without the harmful byproducts of smoke. Many (r/vaporents) find that vaping results in a smoother, less anxiety-inducing experience. It‚Äôs also easier on the lungs and can be more efficient in using your herb, which helps both financially and health-wise.

Have you experimented with different consumption methods to see what gives you the best experience?",1,chanda_solo,0
hjz7um7,"insomnia,melatonin,sleep",,treedibles,"Thanks! I went and followed that guy on IG, he has some great content wow good looking out!  I was battling insomnia for a month or so and tried all different types of stuff from Delta 8/CBD/CBN, sleep hypnosis videos on YouTube, some of those helped me sleep but never back to back nights. But once I started getting my sleep hygiene back into rhythm that‚Äôs when i was finally able to get consistent sleep. I stop watching tv & being on my phone at same time every night then read anywhere from 20-45 mins in the dimmest of lights and that puts me out every night. I still take some melatonin & that really helps to get me back to sleep when I wake up throughout the night/early morning. Thanks again!",0,chanda_solo,1
lc0e0gn,"hurt,pain",,treedibles,"More likely it's just that many dispensary edibles are made with THC extract and not whole flower, strain specific like you can do at home.  A lot of dispensary edibles are made with low grade extract that tests out okay but is so off in quality that it can't be smoked/dabbed and they're recovering product by ""hiding"" it in edibles, which NEVER ends well for the consumer but is GREAT for the cannabis processor.

I do single strain cookies from cheap tested flower I buy at dispensaries and they function different per strain as well as instead of just deep sixing your endocannabinoid system by saturating it with pure THC you get a more rounded and pleasant experience and even a lot of your terps will still be in there, if the source material had decent terps.  Terps are essential oils, will bond right with the butter just like phytocannabinoids.

So you may feel ""more"" high with the full spectrum edible/extract (FSE) but it won't be as intense as a pure THC breakover (which I suspect is the source or a lot of people ""greening out"" more than too strong or whatever, they're hammering THC only into their system and something's going to flake out) which tends to ruin my day because it's essentially smoked me straight and I have to start medicating all over again.

I don't build up tolerance either; I suspect it's my brain chemistry (I have ADHD III).  If I don't wake n bake I will get super high on my first bong hit of the afternoon, like stupid high.  But I must wake n bake because medical issues and there's no other medicine that can touch cannabis for helping me live life without part of my spinal cord got lost in an accident (allergic to opioids and you can't live on benzos, they will kill you too but just slower and you'll be laughing as you go).  If I let my levels get too far down **bad** things start happening, spasms, non epileptic seizures, crazy pains and loss of mobility, it comes on fast and can hit hard - unlike an epileptic, I am fully awake during all levels of seizures/hypertonicity...yeah it does suck to be awake for it, because that shit hurts like a motherfucker.

So I'd rather have it just not happen.  If I have to give up my afternoon trip to the void then so be it; better than being in a pain ball and carried  out in a blanket.",0,chanda_solo,1

1cgmk0c,"anxiety,nervous",,vaporents,"Just got my solo 3 and it's fucking awesome | I said fuck it and got the solo 3 as my first dry herb vape. I was nervous I would regret spending that much money, but it's worth every fucking penny.

My first impressions for dry herb vaping is that it feels more pure if that makes sense. I feel so fucking good. The same strain that I smoke daily would normally give me a little anxiety, but out of the vape I'm so fucking chill.

On demand mode is perfect for me. Heat it up quick and take a few drags and I'm feeling good for awhile. I can't wait to try session mode with some friends in a couple weeks. 

I would say if you're a first time buyer on the fence, absolutely go for it. Don't forget the TVG20 code if it's still active ",1,chanda_solo,1

j3m7noz,"pain,worry",,waxpen,"After researching for the same thing you are I ended up buying a yocan cubex. I actually canceled an order for an orbit to switch up for the cubex.

It's designed to pack it up more and has a big bowl with their new tgt coils.

 I don't like the design of the coils as I cannot see inside of it to clean so gonna have to just try soak and burn. I've been packing this thing up and it's ripping. Definitely could pack it up and it would last u a day at work and looks like a little nic vape. Very discreet and wil keep your concentrate in place because of how it is designed and if you settle it in with a preheat. 

I also used to vape nic out of a 2 coil rta on a drag 2 for many years. Drag 2 is a beast. I bought a new one at some point as an emergency backup and it's still new in the box because my first one never had an issue. If I could find a good atomizer to throw on one of em it would be sweet but then you gotta worry about batteries for it and recharging them in the charger all the time. That shit used to be a pain in the ass going to festivals with enough batteries. With say a cubex or an orbit, you could easily charge it once a day whereas I would never charge a drag from it's usb port. Probably 1 of the reasons mine lasted so long. I never did after a friend of mines usb port randomly lit on fire one day.",0,chanda_solo,1

1lel316,"pain,stress",,weed,"How long for CHS symptoms to resolve? | This is my 32nd episode of CHS (Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome) to date over 8 years and it started on the 13th and haven't been able to eat or drink anything since. Sometimes I'll feel fine during the day but often at night and in the morning I get sick again out of nowhere.

I think the longest an episode has lasted me was about two weeks or just under and I have court on the 27th so I got until then to get better. 

It's still 9 days off and I feel better at times but whenever I drink anything, whether it's half a cup of water or 6, it all comes right back up.  

Also whenever I sit in the hot bath or shower, the pain is significantly reduced and that's my only form of relief. 

I'm 30 in less than 40 days and can't stress enough how terrible this horrible condition is. I know I have to quit smoking weed forever but with addiction it's really hard sometimes. 

There was only 3 times I was able stop above 50+ days, and all times greatly improved the quality of my life. ",0,chanda_solo,1
