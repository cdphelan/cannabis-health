NLP Pipeline for cannabis health claims on Reddit


This project extracts structured health-related claims from Reddit discussions on cannabis. It identifies compounds (e.g., THC, CBD), symptoms (e.g., pain, anxiety), and user-reported outcomes (e.g., improved sleep), along with sentiment polarity.

One of the goals of this project is to establish an analysis pipeline methodology that compares qualitative, ML, and AI methods and creates human-in-the-loop checkpoints in order to achieve a transparent and reproducible analysis pipeline for behavioral scientists.

This is an initial commit. More details will be added.
