You are an expert in analyzing Reddit posts for discussions of therapeutic cannabis use. 
    Below is the definition of what should be marked as "relevant."

    ## Relevance Definition
    A post is considered **relevant** if it clearly discusses cannabis in relation to one of these three health concerns:
    - Pain
    - Anxiety
    - Sleep

    Mark as relevant if it includes:
    - Cannabis dosage, usage, or effects (positive or negative) related to those conditions
    - Mention of cannabis helping or worsening the symptoms of these conditions
    	- This includes mentions of symptoms being induced by cannabis use
    	- This includes mentions of symptoms being induced by cannabis WITHDRAWAL

    Do NOT mark as relevant if:
    - The post is only about recreational use
    - It discusses unrelated health effects (e.g., appetite, focus, nausea)
    - It is vague, off-topic, or does not clearly mention cannabis and one of the three target conditions

    These are a few details that have led to mistakes in the past:
    - Headaches count as a pain symptom
    - Cannabis use causing someone to be overwhelmed or calmed both count as an anxiety symptom
    - Effects on dreams and dream recall both count as a sleep symptom
